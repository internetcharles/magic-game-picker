        "storyline": "Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.", 
        "summary": "Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).",

Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro's blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve...\n\nSamurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.",

When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years. During his incarceration, Kiryu is expelled from his organization, the Tojo Clan, and Yumi goes missing. After his release, he learns that ten billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan's private bank, and that the entire Japanese underworld is now searching for the lost wealth.",

A mysterious young girl will lead Kazuma to the answers if he can keep her alive.",

The development of the game started before the completion of the original and its development caused the cancellation of Black Isle Studio's Fallout 3. Like Fallout 3, the game was near completion when it was canceled. Like its predecessor, the game would have used the Dark Alliance Engine. It was targeted for a Christmas 2004 release date.\n\nLike other Fallout games, the game would have used a reputation system, only simpler. The game would have featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies. Depending on whether the player is good or evil, the game would have played out differently. Each of the four characters that were playable would have had a different fighting style, therefore each time the player played the game, they would have a different experience. It would have had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends. The Dark Alliance Engine would have been fleshed out and player experience would have been refined. A brand new sneak system would have been added to the game. This system would have allowed players to stealthily follow enemies or use a sniper rifle on them. For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.",

So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry. \n \nThe game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. \n \nThe game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.",

Set in Japan with hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows gamers to breathe life to a \"lost episode\" as one of three playable characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style, calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible, opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented tactically during combat.",

For consistency's sake, the main character will be referred to as Kite, the default name for the character.\n\nKite has been invited by his friend, Yasuhiko, to play The World. While Yasuhiko, known as the legendary player Orca, shows Kite the ropes, the two encounter Aura. Just as Aura is about to entrust Orca with the Book of Twilight, Skeith attacks. Orca tries to defend himself and Kite but is no match for Skeith and ends up being Data Drained. Just as Skeith is about to do the same to Kite, someone distracts Skeith and transports Kite to Net Slum. There, the Book of Twilight is added to his inventory. It was at this time that The World's servers crashed.", 
        "summary": ".Hack//Infection is the first of a series of four games, titled .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and .hack//Quarantine, features a \"game within a game\"; a fictional massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called The World which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of .hack//Liminality, the accompanying original video animation series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a multimedia franchise called Project .hack which explores the mysterious origins of The World. Set after the events of the anime series .hack//Sign, the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose as a result of playing The World. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of The World and its effects on the stability of the Internet.",

He meets a woman named Trish who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord Mundus, who is responsible for the deaths of Dante's brother and mother.", 
        "summary": "Originally intended to be the fourth installment in the Resident Evil series, Devil May Cry is an action-adventure game that introduced a host of new elements to the gaming community. Chief among them is the Stylish Rank, which grades the player's performance in combat. The game is split into Missions, which are individually scored according to various factors, such as Orbs gathered and damage taken. Additionally, Devil May Cry did away with the pre-rendered backgrounds of prior Resident Evil games in order to allow for a dynamic camera system.",

After a quick intervention with Balmung, the two return to Dun Loireag, where Kite is told that his Book of Law he won from the Level Up Campaign has an error that prevents it from being installed, so it is replaced with the Book of Absolute (which also cannot be installed). BlackRose claims to have never heard of the event.\n\nThe two receive e-mails telling them to come to \u0398 Soaring Sky Bounded Abyss if they want to know more about the coma victims. It is actually a trap set up by system administrator Lios. Lios says that they should not pursue the matter any further and proceeds to delete Kite's character data along with the bracelet. Helba, however, interferes, saying that they cannot be deleted because of a mysterious encryption implanted in their character data. She introduces the theory that The World is based on the Epitaph of Twilight, telling the two to look to the Epitaph for clues. She then suggests to Lios to observe the two rather than try to delete them. Lios eventually agrees, deciding to use the two and the unique abilities of the bracelet to investigate the corrupted areas.",

Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of .hack//Liminality, the accompanying original video animation series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a multimedia franchise called Project .hack which explores the mysterious origins of The World. Set after the events of the anime series .hack//Sign, the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose as a result of playing The World. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of The World and its effects on the stability of the Internet.",

Kite then moves on to the newly opened \u03a9 Server to discuss the next move, but the server crashes, forcing Helba to connect everyone to her mirror server. Helba's server has all the same functions, except the server looks like Net Slum. Now that they are relatively safe, Helba says that the Wave is still moving and that she will work on a vaccine to defeat it. Lios then orders Kite to measure data fluctuations by going to \u03a9 Bigoted Snowflake's Capsule.\n\nShortly after getting the data for Lios, it is reported that the Nizato University Hospital, the place Yasuhiko is being hospitalized in, suffered a blackout. Kite does not have much time left. Luckily, he gets another clue from Net Slum resident Spiritas, who tells him of Harald having something to do with \u03a3 Screaming Wind Sand's Fate Castle. At the bottom is yet another room, this time with a lone tree at sunset and another Epitaph fragment.",

Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of .hack//Liminality, the accompanying original video animation series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a multimedia franchise called Project .hack which explores the mysterious origins of The World. Set after the events of the anime series .hack//Sign, the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose as a result of playing The World.

It's a part of the Simple 2000 series by Japanese publisher D3 Publisher, as part of a series of budget priced games that usually sell at 2000\u00a5.\n\nYou play as Aya, a scantily clad cowgirl with a scarf, in a hack-and-slash against slow-moving zombies in little arena's. There is a feature called \"sword fatigue\": if you don't clean your sword in time, it will get stuck in an enemy, giving him an advantage over you. There are also slight RPG elements. You can upgrade your characters by collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies. At the end of each level, you can use the orbs to make Aya more powerful. Sometimes the enemies drop red orbs; if you collect enough of them, you turn into a demon. Your attacks become more powerful, but they also take away from your health.",

The game plays very differently from its predecessors, as it puts much more emphasis on style rather than simple demon slaying. As such, combat is much more intense and faster than before. An all-new Style system that allows you to select your fighting style has also been incorporated.",

Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..",

In it, players become the character Leo Stenbuck, who sees the consequences of fighting first hand as he learns the true meaning of life and death. Combining state of the art PlayStation 2 graphics, tons of weapons, and an involving storyline, Zone of the Enders also provides a dynamically changing mission structure, a versus mode for two players, and a playable demo of Metal Gear Solid 2: Snake Eater in all first-run production copies.",

Mia lacks her usual energy and is not in the mood to join Kite. At Mac Anu, Mistral reveals that she is a pregnant housewife and as a result can't continue to aid Kite despite her wish to see the adventure through to the end. As a result of these events happening at around the same time, Kite begins to doubt if he is doing the right thing, much to the dismay of BlackRose. Even so, Kite continues to follow clues wherever he finds them.\n\nAt \u03a3 Chatting Snaring Twins, Kite travels the dungeon alone and picks up data left by Harald. At the bottom is Balmung fighting a Data Bug by himself. After Kite helps him defeat the anomaly, the two talk and finally decide to join forces, agreeing that they need each other's power. Balmung leads Kite deeper and into another white room, this one with hundreds of butterflies in it.", 
        "summary": ".Hack//Outbreak is the third of a series of four games, titled .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and .hack//Quarantine, features a \"game within a game\"; a fictional massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called The World which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of .hack//Liminality, the accompanying original video animation series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a multimedia franchise called Project .hack which explores the mysterious origins of The World. Set after the events of the anime series .hack//Sign, the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose as a result of playing The World. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of The World and its effects on the stability of the Internet.",

Katenas are powerful warriors with the ability to encase themselves in full suits of armor called \"Lexes\". The Katenas are the envoys of the gods. The three great Katenas, chosen by the gods, are collectively referred to as \"Oz\".\n\nBoth humans and Katenas are overseen by the gods. As in Greek mythology, the gods are described as omnipotent, ambitious, self-serving, and power-hungry. The major source of their power is light; as they consume light, they cast parts of the world into darkness for centuries. The gods seek to destroy humanity and drain the planet's energy source, \"Etheria\".",

This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Exclusive to Samurai Warriors Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features.

In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as \"Musou Mode\"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).\n\nThe difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.",

On his quest Hiro will find many weapons of different classes, such a short swords and spears. These weapons will become damaged over time and eventually break, but they can be repaired with an item Hiro can find.

        "storyline": "God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army. \nKratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos. \n \nAfter a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue.", 
        "summary": "God of War II is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released for the PlayStation 2 console on March 13, 2007, it is the second installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically, and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal, and take revenge on Zeus. \n \nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installment. It focuses on combo-based combat which is achieved through the player's main weapon\u2014Athena's Blades\u2014and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require players to quickly complete various game controller actions to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared to its predecessor, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses. \n \nGod of War II has been acclaimed as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games, and was 2007's \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 2009, IGN listed it as the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, and both IGN and GameSpot consider it the \"swan song\" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2012, Complex magazine named God of War II the best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It was the best-selling game in the UK during the week of its release and went on to sell 4.24 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. God of War II, along with God of War, was remastered and released on November 17, 2009 as part of the God of War Collection for the PlayStation 3. The remastered version was re-released on August 28, 2012 as part of the God of War Saga, also for the PlayStation 3. A novelization of the game was published in February 2013. \n \nThe European/Australian PAL version was released as two different editions: a single-disc standard edition and a two-disc \"Special Edition\" with different box art and a bonus DVD.",

It should be noted that the game also has a few hidden features such as holding attack during lock-on to do a charge attack, double jumping and throwing shuriken to do a shuriken burst, and a stun kick by press down and attack while locking on.\n\nThe main objectives of the levels is to kill. No item fetching is required, however the ninjutsu scrolls come in handy, and some levels require Hotsuma to break stone pillars to continue. Shinobi also contains combo features. One of these features is called a \"tate\" kill, whereby if enemies are killed in a chain, a cutscene will play killing all enemies at once and dropping more Yin for your blade. The other feature is that as Hotsuma kills with his cursed blade \"Akujiki\", the sword will change different colors indicating different damage multipliers.", 
        "summary": "Gamers waited many years for another installment of the Shinobi series. Now they finally get what they have wanted.\n\nShinobi takes place in Tokyo, where a mysterious evil force has taken over, and it is up to you to stop it. You play Hotsuma, who is the leader of a clan called the Oboro Clan. Hotsuma is the only survivor of his clan and all of his dead clansmen are now fighting against him due to this evil force.",
