All of the world-class riders, demanding circuits, fantastic machines, plus more are ready to provide the greatest thrills. The podium beckons and the asphalt grinds as 500ccs of thunder are set to explode once again.", 
        "summary": "Namco, the genius company behind Tekken and Ridge Racer, has also proved itself a dab-hand at the motorcycle racing game. Early 2001, the arcade giant released Moto GP for PlayStation 2, and its runaway success quickly led to the research of a sequel. After considerable development time, Namco return with the second instalment.\n\nMoto GP 2 players can expect a glut of updates. New season statistics have naturally been included, and there are now 10 circuits to race on, all of which are genuine true-to-life tracks, bustling with interactivity. The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.\n\nThe gameplay is as polished as ever, with easy-to-learn controls, a steady learning curve, and AI that doesn\u2019t make you want to tear your hair out... at least until you reach the later stages of the game. Moto GP 2 also offers the usual Championship and Time Trial mode of play. But, in typical Namco fashion, multiplayer mode is where the majority of the fun is to be had. In the entire history of video games, the ability to play the same game with one or more friends is still one of the most welcome features in a game.\n\nMoto GP 2 doesn\u2019t disappoint in this regard. It\u2019s frantic, it gets personal, and that\u2019s what makes it interesting. A grand sequel, all in all. Well worth a look, even if you own the original.",

As with many of the developer's games most of the content is locked from the start : for example only the four first characters can be chosen when you first start a game : Mr Mouse, Mr Hamster, Mr Rat and Mr Guinea Pig. Other characters, boats, tracks and race classes become available after collecting a number of stars.\n\nThe other power-ups are extra lives, power boosts and nutritious items, such as red donuts, green puffs or yellow triangles. Do not forget to \"drive\" over speed stripes to boost your boat, but also collect weapons. These are carrot missiles and pumpkin bombs. But if you use an invincibility shield, no one can use these weapons against you.\n\nFrom the option menu, you can set up sound and music, but also controls and use 8 save slots. As a side feature of the game, the last menu choice gives pet information to kids : chinchillas, mice, Guinea pigs, ferrets, dwarf rabbits, rats, hamsters and rabbits.",

So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry. \n \nThe game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. \n \nThe game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.",

Its action based on the real Master Rallye, the game takes place on a stretch of land that spans Paris to Istanbul, all of which is detailed in full 3D. Priding itself on state-of-the-art vehicle models, MASTER RALLYE is packed with obstacles and hidden bonuses throughout. As would be the case in real life, drivers must parlay quick reflexes and immediate, sharp tactics with a more advanced understanding of strategy, patience, and opponent psychology. Originally released on the PC, the game is the perfect fit for the memory-intensive PlayStation 2 console, and features white-knuckle two-player action.",

The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed.\nAnother new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.",

For undisclosed reasons, the game was not released in the North American market. Though it was necessary to limit the number of cars and courses included, this product still included some of the main features of the Gran Turismo franchise such as races, time attack and license tests. The sneak preview also expressed the latest technology Polyphony Digital had accumulated over the past two years. Featuring 50 of GT4's then-planned 500 cars as well as five courses, this expanded demo was designed as a stop-gap until the complete version was released.",

Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which \"pod\" sidekick to choose. \n \nThere are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges. \n \nThe Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.",

Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.",

A two-player split screen mode is included in the game, as well as the Time Trial and Cup racing modes for one player. The player should choose a craft they like to use in the game, and then go through five series (each including six tracks). After the race has loaded, the screen will show a view of the track. The player will see a countdown that would begin the race. The player must finish at first, second or third place to win. If he or she successfully completed a series, the player unlocks more material. Despite the tracks incorporating twists, turns, loops, corkscrews and jumps, various obstacles are considered avoidable for him or her. Falling off the track is one example. When below the third position, he or she will lose. In addition, there are the boost and health icons throughout each track.",

Set in the year 3010, this game envisions a world where evil governments are desperate for something good to put on TV to entertain their teeming masses. The solution - a race. In this race the runner races around an obstacle strewn track chased by a machine that is a cross between a tank and a steam roller. Stay ahead and you win, get caught and you're history.  \n \nThe player's point of view is always above and in front of the runner, looking back at them as they run towards the camera. The track is littered with objects which the runner must either avoid, jump over, or duck under. These obstacles can just pop up out of the track as the runner approaches so quick reactions are needed. \n \nThere are three game modes:  \n \nStandard Mode: here there is the Single sprint mode where the player can practice any unlocked circuit. Then there's the Multiple Sprint mode which is locked until Tournament Mode has been completed, completing the Multiple Sprint mode unlocks 16th stadium.  \n \nTournament Mode: here there are five leagues, completing a league will unlock further stadiums and hence give access to the next league. Completing the final league unlocks stadium fifteen and the Multiple Sprints mode  \n \nExploration Mode: Here the player has to complete series of races that unlock new characters.",

And, to make a name for a new legend again, fame-hungry people will visit the Shutok\u014d.\n\nTo wander around and pursue their prey.\n\nThose who sharpen thei skills with a lone wolf.\n\nAbove all the people who nearly match \"Jintei\" 'skills are 13 DRIVERS known to be hostile and feared, also known as the \"13 Devils\".\n\nRepeated battles, many of those who have defeated local rivals will get the chance to challenge them.

Is this where she smiles at?\nChapter 3 : Show must goes on\n\nThe stage's asphalt emerges along the road.\n\nAn instant sonic drama is performed every night.\n\nWhile extracting the lines of the sound from the muffler at \"Kanj\u014d\" and \"Shinkanj\u014d\", where everyone dreams of becoming the road leader.\n\nActors who don't know the defeat on one stage.

Also features GT Force and GT Force Pro wheel support.\nFor American gamers (this being the first of the series here), the game has been kept close to the Japanese original (including all the real pro Japanese drivers). A tutorial mode is added to teach players the unique demands of professional drift racing, and the game's brutal commentator team has been redone with snide English-language voices.",

        "storyline": "The story is set one year after Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction and before Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, as that's when the Thirteen Devils broke up.\n\nIntro :\n\nThe \"Kaido Circuit\" extends throughout Japan. High-speed battles unfold as drivers enter all kinds of races, seeking to test themselves. Striving for the top, racers battle one another day after day.\n\nAt night, the dark side of the Circuit emerges: a private world known only to racers, where \"Survival of the Fittest\" is the only rule. Gossip leads to rumors, and rumors grow into the stiff of legend...\n\nOne such legendary racer once existed. He was called the Emotional King, a veritable god in the Kaido World. However, they say that he suddenly vanished after a race in Aso...\n\nWith the Emotional King gone from the Kaido night scene, two dominant figures emerged: Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit.\n\nThey came from Category Races and were already \"legitimate\" racers. These 2 are now rumored to be the best that Kaido has to offer.\n\nThen a legendary metropolitan team, The Thirteen Devils, apparently took it upon themselves to stem the flow of metropolitan racers crossing over into Kaido.\n\nCan anyone defeat the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit?\n\nWhat has become of the Emotional King?\n\nHas the Kaido Circuit really been overrun by the Thirteen Devils?\n\nAnd where is the next legendary racer?\n\nAs the battle begins, a team has been formed to fight against the 13 Devils: Kingdom Twelve, whom their leader's real identity is mysterious.\n\nIn the meantime, all Slashers (Stage 1 : MMC Ooaza and World Supremacy, Stage 2 : Haruna Guardian, Lonely Wanderer and Metal Wizard, Stage 3 : Final Leg, New Moon and Global Winner) and the double aces Yeti Fang and Murder Supremacy are preparing themselves as the 13 Devils may eventually challenge them.\n\nWhile everyone is ready, the player arrives and defeats every Slashers who ask if he/she would join them against the 13 Devils. Meanwhile, after Global Winner's defeat, Kyoichi Imaizumi (Yeti Fang) and Tastu Zoshigaya (Supremacy Murder), described as 2 witnesses of the last battle, discuss about that battle :\n\n\"What did you think of that battle?\"\n\n\"Hmm... He races rough, but still fast. He's obviously not from the racing circuit...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I agree. He came here on his own, and he's out to battle us now. We've got nowhere left to run. All we can do now is accept his challenge.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'll make it perfectly clear who the better racer is. My technique is tempered by experience, it's unbeatable. What I want to know is, where did he come from..?\"\n\nThen, both the Kingdom Twelve and the Thirteen Devils are being defeated one by one. Meanwhile, a person begins to doubt about the Kingdom's objective as it seems that the leaders are strangely friendly. Furthermore, after the player defeats Timber Slash, the identity of Kingdom Twelve's leader is revealed by her: Hamagaki, the former Emotional King, AKA Kaido President. Apparently, he lost against Kokami just before Zoshigaya beat him.\n\nAs both the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit were defeated, a new course has been opened : Hokkaido, where only the best drivers are there. By reading the messages, the player can see that the 13 Devils' leader is here : Motoya Iwasaki, AKA Speed King, and some legend drivers are here, such as God Shift Bunta, the High Empress (former Lovers' leader) and someone who drives a black and red Lancer Evolution III but no one can remember his identity.\n\nWhen the Empress is defeated, the real goal of the Kingdom Twelve is revealed by her as she was recruited by Hamagaki, but declined his offer : \"Kingdom Twelve's ostensible goal is to get all the Tokyo racers and all the highway racers under their thumb. Then, once they've conquered the highways, they'll transform into the ultimate rally team and make a new start\", meaning that Hamagaki wants to build his own \"racing utopia\".\n\nAs Kaido President and Speed King are defeated, the black and red Lancer Evolution III is revealed to be the long lost Emotional King : Taiju Kokami, who wanted to make a fresh start as Emotional King. After his defeat, a new team shows up after the great battle : Revival Of Sodom, lead by Zaiga Koshigaya, who appears to have known Kokami for a long time as he was his friend. Even though Zoshigaya is one of the best drivers, he lost to them, so everyone asked if the player can do something about them as the new legendary racer.",

Tokyo is plunged into chaos and now two more cities want to compete: Osaka and Nagoya. The racers here will have to beat every team in these 3 cities, and maybe, have the opportunity to challenge the best drivers in each: Speed King & Dejected Angel in Tokyo, Seeks, Genesis R & D3 in Nagoya and No Loser & Darts in Osaka.", 
        "summary": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 (or \u9996\u90fd\u9ad8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb 01 in the Japanese release) was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of Genki's Shutokou Battle series. This entry in the series was released two years after the previous game, Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero.\n\nMuch like other entries in the series, the objective is to become the fastest racer on the highways of Japan, but unlike those before it, TXR3 allows the players to race in Nagoya and Osaka instead of just Tokyo, and the Tokyo map is expanded to include the Yokohama area. In addition, this title adds a weather cycle.\n\nTXR3 includes a fully-licensed list of cars from a variety of Japanese, American, and European manufacturers instead of the old car model designation method of \"Type-(technical model name)\", and furthermore, the car list itself was culled of many repeat models so to simplify and reduce the number of cars. The A, B, and C car designations were also removed.\n\nGraphically speaking, Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 is a definite improvement over previous entries. Car models feature a higher polygon count and are much more extensively detailed and lighting effects were also greatly improved, featuring light streaking effects, road reflections and higher quality car reflections.",

        "storyline": "The game begins with Vetch (voiced by Steve Tarlow) receiving a transmission from his lieutenant, Overlord (Jason Gregory), who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice. Rather than kill Haven, Vetch decides to watch him, hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage. Meanwhile, in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra, Haven (Jake Rosewall-Gallagher) is completing his latest invention; a mechanical bird named Talon. Upon finishing, Haven heads to work in the mines. However, upon entering, he sees his friend Chess (Regan Kerwan) being questioned by a guard. The guard tries to shoot Haven, but misses, and causes the mine to collapse, knocking out Haven.\n\nHe awakens under the treatment of Dr. Spong (Andrew Silber), who tells him Chess hasn't been seen since the collapse. Setting out to find her, he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle, as they planned. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams. She refuses to tell him anything, and Haven intervenes, killing Overlord and freeing Chess. They escape, and Chess says that while in detention, she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes. Haven decides he must speak to this slave.\n\nHaven heads to the Isle of Heroes, and meets the Wise Man (Terry Bertram). He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain, and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice; Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years, and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, he was unable to even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, he left behind the Golden Bell, but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote. Making the people of Aurias his slaves, he sealed off the Mount of Sighs, on which resides the Golden Voice. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias, the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash, and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount.\n\nHaven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. However, as he escapes Firash, he is captured and placed in the Sylex, a space station prison. He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco, a planet populated by lizard-like humanoids. He soon meets brothers Chill (Dale Stump) and Will (Aubrey Hodges). They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoid-like creatures. Haven does so, however, the insect queen attacks the local village. Haven defeats her, and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer. He then heads to Auria.\n\nHe makes it to the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess. She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlord's castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves. Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven.\n\nThey pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship, and the duo escape. However, Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along, who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.\n\nHaven escapes, but is unable to free Chess, and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone, promising to return for Chess. He returns to the Mount of Sighs, where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead. He then kills Athellion. Haven confronts him, but Vetch defeats him. However, the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive. As such, Vetch ties Haven to a rock, pointing out \"you can't live forever\" and leaves him alone on the planet. The game ends on this cliffhanger.", 
        "summary": "The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.",

        "summary": "Formula One 05 for the PlayStation 2 was released in Europe on July 1, 2005, and in Australia later that year. It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.\n\nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n\nSee also[edit]",

This entire setting is set in a theme park-style arena called Gallop Racing Square. \n \nNot only can players create their own horses, but they can also race classic and legendary horses from previous years in the history of horse racing. The gameplay is virtually the same as previous versions, pressing buttons at a certain point in time to urge the horse while racing, with several gauges to monitor such as the horses stamina, their position in the race as well as their mental condition. Players can also bet in races, with a true feel of betting simulation, figuring in weather conditions, the horses conditions as well as the horses stats.",

        "summary": "Genki's racing games have typically fallen into the Shutokou Battle series, a collection of late-night racing games that put you on the highways surrounding Tokyo. The company's latest PS2 racer, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, maintains many of the same gameplay mechanics that Genki's other games contain, but this time it takes the cars off of the streets and drops them onto proper racetracks.\n\nRacing Battle will contain licensed cars. The version on display only has a handful, including an RX-7, a Supra, an Integra, an Impreza, and an S2000. The car models in the game look decent. They're nice and smooth, but they don't seem to be quite as detailed as the car models in some other comparable racing games.\n\nLike most other racing games, Racing Battle has multiple camera angles. But the first-person angle is pretty interesting. From this view, you get indicators that show how hard you're steering, accelerating, or braking. You also get a second, TV-style camera angle in a small window at the top of the screen. This is cool because it gives you a good idea of what's going on near your car. It's easy to see cars coming up behind you with this view and more effective than a standard rearview mirror.\n\nThe gameplay in Racing Battle is roughly the same as what Genki has done with Shutokou and Kaido Battle series. Each car is associated with a fighting gamelike life meter, and the car in second place constantly loses pieces of its life meter. When one car runs out of \"health,\" the race ends and a winner is declared.",

New outfits may be earned by completing a character's trick book, by doing a number of specific tricks during play.
