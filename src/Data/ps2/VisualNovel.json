The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.", 
        "summary": "There are three playable characters, one from each of the schools: Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna. They have no family names in the game, as when the series of short stories were first published. While Ai Shimizu maintained her role for Kizuna in the game, Miyuki Sawashiro performed the voice for Tamao Suzumi. The game features a \"boy mode\" and a \"girl mode\". Choosing the male version means that the story is told via emails from the player's younger sister; choosing the female version means that the story is told in the player's own diary. The player is given the chance to pair their chosen character with one of the other nine available girls, not including the other possible playable characters. There are twenty-seven different combinations depending on which girl the player chooses at the start of the game.",

A love so wonderful that you can just declare it like that, could I feel that way too someday?\n\nBut coming back from my study abroad I was struck by some sudden news.\nYukari killed herself!?\nThere's no way that happened, she was so happy the last time I saw her.\n\nIn order to find the truth of the incident I'm going to work at the same company in the same secretary role that she had from today on.",

His latest destination is a small, sleepy town where summer has just arrived; and his encounter with a young girl named Misuzu there sets the wheels of destiny turning....\n\nCLANNAD:\nTomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student at Hikarizaka Private High School, leading a life full of resentment. His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope. This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya\u2019s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa, questioning if she likes the school at all. He finds himself helping her, and as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life heading towards a new direction.\n\nKanon:\nYuuichi Aizawa, a high school student, returns to a town that he last visited 7 years previously to live with his aunt and cousin. For a reason he\u2019s not quite sure of, he can hardly remember anything about his last visit, but initially this doesn\u2019t seem to worry him too much.\n\nThe day after he arrives he goes into town where he (literally) bumps into a girl named Ayu Tsukimiya, and Yuuichi\u2019s memories slowly begin to return.",

He enters a local space race hoping to earn a bit of money and fame for himself, but winds up losing by a hair. However, his performance attracts the attention of a recruiter for the Lightning Express shipping company, and soon he's hired on as their newest cargo pilot. Unfortunately, Lightning Express is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, uses outdated and poorly-maintained equipment, and is generally a laughingstock across the galaxy. But everyone's got to start somewhere, right?",

The player takes the role of rookie cargo pilot Rex as he tries to make a name for himself with the crew of his ship, the Jack Pot. Like most visual novels, the game progresses linearly, with occasional dialogue choices affecting the flow of the story. At certain points, the player can explore the ship and speak with its crew and passengers freely. There are also so-called \"Live Command\" sequences when situations get heated or particularly dangerous; during these events, choices have a strict time limit, it is not possible to save or reload the game, and incorrect choices can easily lead to losing a job or even a game over.",

She leaves her school life to join Nyx's Thanatos exterminating business: \"Aube Hunters\".

Her goal is to work with her fellow Aube Hunters to eradicate Thanatos and restore the land's peace.",

Maki Fujioka was the character designer for the characters' animated counterparts, both in the game and for the TV series. Character image songs were composed by Yujiro Okazaki.\n\nRuby Party originally devised the game to be a minor side story for the main Angelique series. During the brainstorming sessions for the plot and characters, the members realized that their project's ambitions far surpassed their starting expectations. Therefore, they shifted gears to make an \"Angelique title friendly to newcomers\", seeking to capture the series's charm without requiring the player to have extensive knowledge of prior lore. Role-playing game elements were devised to take center stage in gameplay due to its popularity in fan surveys at the time. The keywords for this title's narrative are \"beautiful, noble, and romantic\".\n\nThe Premium Box included eight postcards, a character message CD and fully colored comic book/manual. Consumers who reserved the game or Full Voice through Gamecity Shopping received a mouse pad with their purchase.",

The construction is hidden deep in the valley and the only way to enter is through a rope bridge. Nagomu learned of the history of the castle during dinner with the current owner of the castle.\n\nThe ancestor of the young nobleman has been studying black magic and satanic rites. He has been trying to summon a demon by offering youths as sacrifices. After numerous failed attempts, he finally managed to call upon a demon to possess his sacrifice. The castle is then built in the valley to keep the possessed youth from escaping. The youth's mother has entered the castle to find her son, but she too disappeared not long afterwards.\n\nAccording to the rumors, the ghost of the mother is still in search of her son and the youth is still somewhere within the castle.\n\nDuring the conversation, the castle is blacked out, and in the darkness the occupants can feel the evil in the air.",

To Makoto's surprise, Sekai gives him her full and enthusiastic support. Her encouragment brings fresh color to his dull, uneventful life.\n\nFrom the moment she drags the two of them to their first lunch together, the barriers between Makoto and Kotonoha begin to fall. Sekai, however, grows increasingly distracted, as if lost in her own thoughts.\nOn the platform at dusk, Makoto waits for Kotonoha to arrive for their first date.\nSekai passes by on the way home from school.\n\nGrateful for her part in bringing him and Kotonoha together, Makoto promises to do anything he can to thank her.\n\nA moment later, Makoto stands there on the platform, stunned.\n\nOn the train, Sekai clasps her phone, a picture of Makoto set within.\n\nKotonoha hurries towards the station, a cheerful smile on her face.\n\nAnd so, as three hearts burn with three different emotions, the story begins.",

Keiichi soon learns of the village's annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local deity Oyashiro. Hinamizawa initially seems calm and peaceful, but shortly before the festival, Keiichi learns that from 1979-1982, after the festival, one villager would die and another would disappear. This series of mysterious incidents remains unsolved, and is named the \"Oyashiro-sama's Curse\" by the superstitious villagers.",

The game now got some different part since the player has to manage the eatery and the waitresses, all of whom are lovely and potential love interests. During each week he has to decide about the coffee shop menus, the prices, what will be the waitress duties during that week and also what he is going to do that week (he can study management, rest, etc.). There are some times during each week that the player is giving some choices (like in all visual novel adventures) and depending of them the game ending will be different. If he got success he can buy new coffee shops, new waitress dresses, etc.",

Although the world is now at peace, there continues to be distrust between the Sphere Kingdom (Moon) and the Earth Federation.

Before the beginning of every week in the game's storyline, the player is given the option to plan a schedule, and is allowed to pick and view any three days of the given week. Different events occur depending on the days that the player chooses. Every so often, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. Depending on which choice the player makes, the \"tear points\" of the heroine associated with the events of the day would either increase, decrease, or remains the same. \"Tear points\" act as a system notifying the player how well he or she is treating a certain character. If a character's tear points exceed the maximum amount of eight, her ending is rendered inaccessible during that specific playthrough. There are multiple plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times and make different schedules and choices during decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.",

The current Devil gets weaker, and it's time to transfer the position to the successor. One day, the news comes out that someone, who lives in the human world, is nominated for the next Devil. Soon after the news comes out, a terrorist group attacks the castle, and Ashe runs out of the castle with Kyle. They run away into the forest, and accidentally fall into the hole to the human world and lose their magic power. They roam around the human world, and bump into twin brothers Leni and Seizh, who are the nominees for the Devil. Ashe asks them to come to the Devil world as soon as possible, but they are not interested in the position. Also, the people in the human world start the Devil hunting, and they lose their way back to the Devil world. Ashe and Kyle start to live at the twins house, but they seem to have a secret...? What will await them in the end..., a pure love story or...?",

In the game, the player takes the role of a male high-school student who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle.",

WWI finally broke out in 1914... eventually the war ended, but a lot of countries still held animosity with each other.\nIn 1923, Erika, a mechanic, and her family lived in Juktland. Her father, Anthony, was also a mechanic. Though he was old, he was still called the 'God of Repair'. Erika was also a good mechanic. One day, Anthony received a command from the Juktland Army. It was to be a airplane mechanic for the Roby Independent Aerial Platoon. Erika didn't want him to overwork himself, so she said, \"I'll go in behalf of him.\" Like this, she was sent to an air base near the border. However, when soldiers first saw her, some despised her, some expected something from her, and some felt disappointed... No one treated her as a full-fledged mechanic... She finally said, \"I'm here as a mechanic. Give me something to do!\"",

He tries to build a beautiful land, but it can never reach the beauty of Heaven: the demons live in troubled times, being attacked by fallen angels who survive the fall to the Abyss, fearing the bloodshed caused by these insane former angels against them. The King starts to become weak and tired, and with his last power, he gave birth to two new hopes: a prince with golden hair born from his red right eye, and a price with silver hair born from his blue left eye.\n\nThe King decides that the two twin prices, Alex and Platina, are to fight each other, and the winner who proves his power will become the new king of Hell, while the loser will face death. As such, Alex and Platina, who never even knew each other, are thrust into a battle against each other, and the future will change depending on the outcome. And hiding in the background, another hand plays in to manipulating their fate...",

After progressing through the text, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she must choose from multiple options. The time between these decision points varies. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there would be an option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.",
