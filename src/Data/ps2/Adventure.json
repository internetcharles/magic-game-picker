        "summary": "Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 is a survival-horror game released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 and a sequel to Resident Evil Outbreak, which was originally envisioned as a much larger game before being cut into multiple releases. The same eight characters from the first title return with similar abilities, and the game takes place once again in a zombie-run Raccoon City. The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe.\n\nThe locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.",

Thus begins We Love Katamari, where the King of All Cosmos seeks to help fulfill the wishes of his fans\u2014with the help from his son and his son's cousins, who again travel Earth, rolling things up into a Katamari.\n\nThe King of All Cosmos\u2019s origin:\nThe King of All Cosmos's history is told in We Love Katamari\u2019s cut scenes, interspersed between the game\u2019s stages.\nThe King of All Cosmos was not always the King. His father was the previous King of All Cosmos (also called Emperor of the Cosmos, or Papa). The future King of All Cosmos grew up either on Earth itself or a planet very much like it, in a giant castle on a hill surrounded by green fields. (Though, early in the game, we are to believe all action takes place in a world called \u201cThe Great Cosmos\u201d.)",

Throughout each level, the play must collect objects in order to fulfill objectives set by the prince's father.",

        "summary": "Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series, developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was also later released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015.\n\nIt is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view.\n\nLike in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.",

        "storyline": "Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.", 
        "summary": "Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).",

Halassar, a province in the Empire of Galdyr, distant from the kingdoms of Medeva and Orenia, was foretold as the birthplace of the Goddess Laharah Reborn. The priestesses of Laharah declared Maia as the goddess when she was an infant and armies rose up in Maia's name, led by the Emperor's brother Prince Taurgis, making Halassar independent from Galdyr and Maia, the Queen of the Halassar Empire.\n\nTraveling with her is Sangaril, an orphan trained by the Shadow Clan assassins of the Munari, who was sent to kill Maia as a child, but instead became her sworn bodyguard. While reclaiming the Book of Prophets from the Halassar Palace traitor Dama Sivora, Maia activates a rune stone embedded in the pirate island stronghold of Prince Neru, on the Isle of Teomura, gaining the ability to transform into one of the 4 Summons. After recovering the Book of the Prophets and returning to the Palace she learns more about her destiny.",

The final game in the series released for that platform, PachiPara 14 once again simulates a handful of Sanyo's Umi Monogatari line of pachislot machines, specifically the CR Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa MTA and SAD models. It is also the last game to feature the long-running PachiPro F\u016bunroku subseries as an open world RPG; while the name went on to reappear in the series 3DS' installments starting with the first release of PachiPara 3D: Taikai Monogatari 2, it transitioned into a predominantly visual novel genre in the wake of series producer and longtime Irem developer Kazuma Kujo leaving the company in March 2011 to form Granzella.",

        "summary": "Diabolik: The Original Sin is a gritty third-person adventure game blending the heritage of the pick-and-click genre with fast-paced action sequences and minigames.\n\nThe original idea of the game is based on the story created by the sisters Angela and Luciana Giussani in 1962 and its comic books. The adventure game is set in an unusual world made of a curious mix between 3D real time graphics and 2D black&white comic style animation.\n\nThe traditional point-and-click genre has been perfectly adapted to the main features of the latest consoles in order to ease the developing of the main plot and minigames. The player is involved in a tricky story full of unexpected twists, intrigue, love and vengeance. In Diabolik\u2019s skin, it won\u2019t take too long to become a skilled thief and a master of disguise to rescue his beloved Eva.\n\nCalled to be the bad guy for once, the player will find himself ensnared in fast-paced combat and stealth sequences. Diabolik is a criminal who likes luxury, expensive cars and robs to enrich himself, following his own morality. Eva, the only woman who can keep up with him, likes being involved in mysterious and complicated stories. Diabolik and Eva make up an unconventional couple; they are lovers and partners in crime.",

When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years. During his incarceration, Kiryu is expelled from his organization, the Tojo Clan, and Yumi goes missing. After his release, he learns that ten billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan's private bank, and that the entire Japanese underworld is now searching for the lost wealth.", 
        "summary": "Just as Kazuma, a former rising star in the Yakuza, emerges from prison after a murder cover-up, 10 billion yen vanishes from the Yakuza vault, forcing him once again into their brutal, lawless world. A mysterious young girl will lead Kazuma to the answers if he can keep her alive.",

As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (\u30e8\u30eb\u30c0 Yoruda?), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair make their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. The Queen destroys part of the bridge; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.\n\nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen. He confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him; he is hit by falling debris, breaking his horns, and he falls unconscious. The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She stirs.",

        "storyline": "After Lord Mei-Oh was defeated in Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Rikimaru was left in Lord Mei-Oh's fortress carrying a giant boulder to provide an escape route for Ayame and Princess Kiku. He appears to be trapped and left for dead. Ayame stuck Rikimaru's sword, \"Izayoi\" (he is seen drawing this sword in the opening CG of Wrath of Heaven) in snow as a monument for her fellow ninja, now considered dead. A year later, Rikimaru reports to Lord Gohda that he has managed to survive this near-death experience; unbeknownst to them, the real Rikimaru is trapped in the 20th century trying to find a way back to their time. \n \nThe game's plot plays differently depending on the character chosen, but connects at certain points. The story revolves mainly around Rikimaru's return and the struggle for the Three Jewels, which are said to give power to those who possess them. These are the Jewels of Heaven, Earth, and Virtue. Tenrai, an evil wizard who wants to get his hands on them, commands a band of his men to take the Jewels from whoever possesses them. However, upon encountering Rikimaru, he seems interested in his power and attempts convincing him to join his men. Rikimaru refuses, and he and Ayame face each one of them. One of the men in Tenrai's arsenal is Onikage, who only serves him to pursue his plan of reviving Mei-Oh (his former master) and Tatsumaru (the former leader of the Azuma Ninja Clan whom Tenrai revived). Rikimaru and Ayame follow Tenrai into his fortress to stop him from destroying the world using the power gained from two of the Jewels. If he can be defeated, peace will be returned to Gohda's land.", 
        "summary": "Move like a shadow. Strike like a snake. \n \nAfter amassing an army of ninjas and lords of darkness, the mysterious Tenrai has begun a quest to conquer 16th-century Japan. Now your master, Lord Gohda, has called upon you - a cunning stealth assassin - to stop Tenrai and his disciples before all is lost. \n \nLive by honor. Kill by stealth.",

Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill and his own past.",

The main character is Jade Cornell, a foxy redhead, whose friend Tyler has gotten too close to the truth. The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins. \n \nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter. \n \nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity. \n \nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.",

        "summary": "Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's \"boost\" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.\n\nEach character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.",

Unfortunately, they are intercepted by Dr. M, the owner of the island. Murray and Bentley escape, but a monster grabs Sly. During this scene, Sly's life flashes before his eyes, and the game flashes back.\n\nSly learned that the Cooper Vault was hidden on Kaine Island from one of his father's colleagues, Jim McSweeney. The vault contains the accumulated wealth of the Cooper Clan built up over the centuries. Sly went to find the vault, only to discover that M had built a fortress on the island in an attempt to get at the wealth hidden in the vault. Sly needed additional experts in order to get past Dr. M's extensive security; he needed the Cooper Gang back in action.\n\nFirst, Sly and Bentley seek Murray, who had left the team due to guilt for causing Bentley's leg injury, which would end up paralyzing him. They learn about a mob boss, Octavio, who operates in Venice, Italy, where Murray was. Sly finds Dimitri in a cell at the local police station. He agrees to find Murray if Sly helps him escape. Sly finds Murray, while evading Carmelita Fox, who had become more hateful towards crimes since their last encounter. Murray had become a trainee for a peace-loving figure known as the Guru in order to become more peaceful. Murray refuses to rejoin Sly and Bentley until the canals are clean, the task the Guru gave to him. Sly and Bentley take down Octavio, who had been polluting the canals with tar as part of a scheme to threaten the city into liking opera again. After putting together some plans, they destroy Octavio's comeback recital, but Octavio injures Bentley, making Murray so mad that he quits his training and battles Octavio and defeats him. Octavio is arrested, and Murray rejoins the team.",

As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is \"captured\" and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.",

        "summary": "Mike LeRoi -- the embittered protagonist of the original Shadow Man title, is tasked yet again with saving Liveside and the parallel world of Deadside. In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.\n\nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.\n\nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.",

The game follows the story of Keiichi Morisato along with all three goddesses - Belldandy and her two sisters, Urd and Skuld. The four of them won a lottery trip which landed them on an uninhabited island shrouded in mysteries. The trip, however, was a trap devised by Marller and Hildr, which made all three goddesses lose their magic. The good thing is that is is retrievable, and it is somewhere on the island. In this third-person 3D adventure game you explore the island and solve various mechanical puzzles while trying to restore Belldandy's, Urd's and Skuld's magical powers.",

He enters a local space race hoping to earn a bit of money and fame for himself, but winds up losing by a hair. However, his performance attracts the attention of a recruiter for the Lightning Express shipping company, and soon he's hired on as their newest cargo pilot. Unfortunately, Lightning Express is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, uses outdated and poorly-maintained equipment, and is generally a laughingstock across the galaxy. But everyone's got to start somewhere, right?", 
        "summary": "Rim Runners is a light-hearted, anime-style sci-fi visual novel. The player takes the role of rookie cargo pilot Rex as he tries to make a name for himself with the crew of his ship, the Jack Pot. Like most visual novels, the game progresses linearly, with occasional dialogue choices affecting the flow of the story. At certain points, the player can explore the ship and speak with its crew and passengers freely. There are also so-called \"Live Command\" sequences when situations get heated or particularly dangerous; during these events, choices have a strict time limit, it is not possible to save or reload the game, and incorrect choices can easily lead to losing a job or even a game over.",

The two have been traveling for a long time on this offbeat path, through murky forests and wet grasslands alike.\n\nThey arrive at last at their destination: a tall stone gate with a narrow passage. On the other side lies an enormous bridge of near-otherworldly construction. The bridge spans over the Forbidden Lands, a dramatic landscape of plains and canyons with enclosed and cut-off environments ranging from arid deserts to clefts with tall geysers to dark forests and murky crevasses.\n\nThe bridge finally comes to an end at the Shrine of Worship, a gigantic structure in the middle of the Lands. Wander and Agro make their way to the ground floor and the temple's main hall, which is lined with sixteen stone idols. At the end of the empty hall is an altar. Here it is shown that Wander is carrying something with him: a body wrapped in a cloth sheet. He places the body on the altar and removes the sheet, revealing Mono, a young woman clothed in a white dress.\n\nThe game suddenly cuts to a picture of an owl mask amidst a cloudy sky. From here, Lord Emon, a spiritual leader in Wander's society, speaks an esoteric monologue:\n\nThat place...began from the resonance of intersecting points...\nThey are memories replaced by ens and naught and etched into stone.\nBlood, young sprouts, sky - and the one with the ability to control beings created from light...\nIn that world, it is said that if one should wish it, one can bring back the souls of the dead.\nBut to trespass upon that land is strictly forbidden...\n\nAgro is suddenly frightened by a noise from behind the trio. Several shadowy apparitions are emerging from the temple floor, and Wander sees this and draws a mysterious sword from its sheath, pointing it towards the shadows. The blade emits an otherworldly energy, and the creatures immediately dissolve into thin air. Immediately, a booming pair of voices fill the halls from a great aperture above, surprised that Wander possesses the \"Ancient Sword\". Wander correctly identifies the voices as belonging to Dormin and asks that Mono be revived. Initially, Dormin expresses an indifference towards the matter, but ultimately cannot hide the interest in the sword Wander carries.",

Running out of petrol and lost in the mountains on a stormy night, Ichiyanagi Nagomu, a university student has no choice but to leave his car and ask for help from the nearest mansion within the woods. However, a shock is waiting for him in that dark night. He finds the corpse of a middle age man lying in the rain at the backyard of the mansion. Without any time to recover from his shock, somebody sneaks up behind him and attacks him.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he is in the company of a troop of actors and actresses there to train for new play written by the famous play-writer Boushiya, and being mistaken as the ninth actor, nobody believed what Nagomu saw at the backyard. Because of the injuries he has suffered earlier and the storm still raging outside, there is no alternative for him but stay in the mansion.\n\nLater that night, the troop and Nagomu discovers a message that reads \"Revenge\" in the green house. Afterwards the troop realized that the tires of their cars have all been punctured and there is no escape route. Fear permeates the air that night, but that is only the beginning of their ordeals. The next day, one of the actors is found dead with his corpse arranged in a peculiar way.\n\nPanic erupts when a landslide cuts the mansion off from the rest of the world and being overpowered by fear, the only thing the actors and actresses think of is to protect themselves. This leaves the case solely upon Nagomu's shoulders since he is the only one unrelated to the act of \"revenge\".",

After defeating her, Ada retrieves the Green Catseye, returns to the church, and solves a puzzle to retrieve the Round Insignia, then switches it with the Green Catseye. She uses the Insignia to enter the church, then solves the light puzzle later seen with Leon to ring the church bell, although bringing down the steel bars that prevented Leon from getting to Ashley.",

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's \"boost\" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.",

As the friends reunite, they stand before a mysterious silver tree on the foreign continent known as Arcadia.

The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the Earth's natural flow of energies and to terrorize the land. The boy that Nozomi met is revealed to be the human form of Hakury\u016b, the White Dragon God said to protect Ky\u014d, whose powers have greatly weakened due to the presence of the onry\u014d. Nozomi discovers that she has the power to seal the onry\u014d as Hakury\u016b no Miko, and she allies herself with the Genji in order to seal the onry\u014d, restore Hakury\u016b's powers, and return home to her own world.",

At the same time, an extremist named Colonel Volgin fires an American-made portable nuclear missile at the Soviet design bureau OKB-754, sparking an international incident. In order for America to clear its name and avoid World War III, a man named John and codenamed Naked Snake is dispatched by the special forces unit FOX to assassinate the woman who taught him everything.", 
        "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the prequel to the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over and as before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.",

Styled similar to cinematography found in The Wachowskis' The Matrix film franchise and gameplay mechanics in games such as Dead to Rights and Max Payne, the player is given an ability to slow down time and thus dodge multitudes of flying bullets and other obstacles. The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities. Between the action sequences, the player must advance the plot through a graphic adventure-style interface, where certain characters must be spoken to in order to continue.",

Use swords, guns, and even barriers made of rice to weaken the Kyonshis, then stab them with your lucky charm. The people you're trying to protect all have unique traits, some being slow, others being weak, and you'll have to study their data in order to properly guide them to safety. You can send commands to the people you're guiding, telling them when to stop and when to play dead (this latter act makes the Kyonshis stop their attack).",

BlackRose claims to have never heard of the event.\n\nThe two receive e-mails telling them to come to \u0398 Soaring Sky Bounded Abyss if they want to know more about the coma victims. It is actually a trap set up by system administrator Lios. Lios says that they should not pursue the matter any further and proceeds to delete Kite's character data along with the bracelet. Helba, however, interferes, saying that they cannot be deleted because of a mysterious encryption implanted in their character data. She introduces the theory that The World is based on the Epitaph of Twilight, telling the two to look to the Epitaph for clues. She then suggests to Lios to observe the two rather than try to delete them. Lios eventually agrees, deciding to use the two and the unique abilities of the bracelet to investigate the corrupted areas.",

        "summary": "Kuon is a horror game set in Heian period (12th century) in Japan. You control three protagonists in the game. The story revolves around a man named Doman, an exorcist who was summoned by one of the noblemen to investigate a cursed manor. His daughter Utsuki is out to search for him when he doesn't return, and her sister is charmed by demons inhabiting a mysterious castle, turning into a demon herself. A young girl named Sakuya, Doman's disciple, also ventures into the depths of the demonic world, to prove herself worthy of her master. Once the player completes Utsuki's and Sakuya's scenarios, he unlocks the third scenario where he experiences the story from the point of view of Doman himself.\n\nThe game is a mixture of third-person action and puzzle-solving. As in all survival horror games, your means of defense are limited and scarce. Unlike most games of the kind, physical attacks with weapons are not your only way to defend yourself against hordes of undead creatures. You can also learn and cast spells in the game, and even summon creatures (wolves, spiders, etc.) to fight at your side.",

This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date. \n \nYour goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode. \n \nThe game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.",

The game plays very differently from its predecessors, as it puts much more emphasis on style rather than simple demon slaying. As such, combat is much more intense and faster than before. An all-new Style system that allows you to select your fighting style has also been incorporated.",

The Cooper family's heirloom, an ancient book by the name The Thievius Raccoonus, records all the secret moves and techniques from every member in the clan. On his 8th birthday, Sly was supposed to inherit the book and learn all of his family's ancient secrets which was supposed to help him become a master thief, however, a group of thugs by the name \"The Fiendish Five\" (led by Clockwerk, who is the arch-nemesis of the family clan) attack the Cooper household and kills Sly's parents and stole all of the pages from the Thievius Raccoonus. After that, the ruthless gang go their separate ways to commit dastardly crimes around the world. Sly is sent to an orphanage where he meets and teams up and forms a gang with two guys who become his lifelong best friends, Bentley, a technician, inventor and a talented mathematical hacker with encyclopedic knowledge who plays the role as the brains of the gang, and Murray, a huge husky cowardly guy with a ginormous appetite who plays the role as the brawns and the getaway driver of the gang. The three leave the orphanage together at age 16 to start their lives becoming international vigilante criminals together, naming themselves \"The Cooper Gang\". Sly swears one day to avenge his family and track down the Fiendish Five and steal back the Thievius Raccoonus. 2 years later, the Cooper Gang head to Paris, France, to infiltrate Itnerpol (a police headquarters) in order to find the secret police file which stores details and information about the Fiendish Five but during the heist they are ambushed by Inspector Carmelita Fox (towards whom Sly develops a romantic attraction), a police officer who is affiliated with Interpol and is after the Cooper Gang. The gang manage to steal the police file and successfully escapes from her and the rest of the cops. With the secret police file finally in their hands, the Cooper Gang manage to track down the Fiendish Five.",

When sends the brothers and to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis.

It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of Season 2 (episodes 27 Teacher and 28 One is all, All is One\") of the 2003 anime series, since the show took a 4 month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the 2nd OP \"READY STEADY GO\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel and the shortened 3rd ED \"Motherland\" by Crystal Kay, since that is the version that was to be shown in the Adult Swim broadcast. As of August 31, 2005, the game has sold 160 thousand units in Japan.",

Instead, the island seems pretty much the same as when he left, but people he knew changed and his rekindled friendship and relationship with people he left behind will bring a change in Kouichi. The game is a visual novel with light background animations, while character only change poses and don't animate during talking, even moving lips while talking and looking in a different direction is done via character stills and not animated. Aside from Kouichi, all NPCs feature full voice-acting. \n \nOriginally released as Clear for PC (Windows), this PlayStation 2 port was done two years after with reduced rating and removed adult content. To compensate for that, the game features new characters, new branching plot, new CG events and new opening song by Ceui. Gameplay interface has also been improved and adjusted for console gameplay.",

Katenas are powerful warriors with the ability to encase themselves in full suits of armor called \"Lexes\". The Katenas are the envoys of the gods. The three great Katenas, chosen by the gods, are collectively referred to as \"Oz\".\n\nBoth humans and Katenas are overseen by the gods. As in Greek mythology, the gods are described as omnipotent, ambitious, self-serving, and power-hungry. The major source of their power is light; as they consume light, they cast parts of the world into darkness for centuries. The gods seek to destroy humanity and drain the planet's energy source, \"Etheria\".",

You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for \"wanted\" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil. \n \nMetal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.",

While game retains the action elements from previous Onimusha, it offers a more varied amount of weapons as well as the option of going back to previous stage to unlock new content. The game also introduces a 3D camera as well as the ability to continuously fight alongside AI controlled characters who move depending on the player's orders. Dawn of Dreams was announced by Capcom due to high fan demand and several Capcom members realizing they could expand the action elements from Onimusha after working in Shadow of Rome. The game was designed in order to appeal to skilled gamers rather than the general market which resulted in appealing designs rather than realistic.",

On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past. The story can unfold in different ways with, in many cases, two or more different versions of a level, which will have slightly different objectives than the original. If the player is thorough and plays through these optional versions, the story and characters may develop even further than before",

        "summary": "Presenting a combination of monster breeding and RPG elements, Jade Cocoon 2 expands upon Genki's original title in a number of significant ways. Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers.\n\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.",

From this point on, you pick locations and explore, the ultimate goal being to discover the identity of the killer that's committing murders all over Nerv and Tokyo-3.

        "storyline": "Thirteen years before the game begins, the world was locked in a war against the Clan of the Moon. Foul monsters known as \"Legions\" were unleashed by the Clan against their enemies in their bid for domination. However, powerful heroes called Forces soon rose up to lead the charge against them. Aided by Force Frames, ordinary warriors became gifted with a variety of powerful advantages that made them more than what they would have been otherwise. With this, the war against the Clan of the Moon began to turn. The Clan's Dark Castle and the Legions were banished in the end. Victory was achieved, but only at a great cost. Several nations were utterly destroyed and most of the Forces that participated in the final battle had perished.\n\nWhen the story starts, a young warrior named Max has nearly completed the training that will make him a Force. Journeying home, he hopes to achieve his dream, not realizing that it is only the beginning of an adventure that will take him and his friends across the world to stop the return of evil.", 
        "summary": "Max completes his Force military training and returns to his village to meet his family and to find news of his missing brother. Later, the village is attacked by monsters later suspected as remnants of the Legion as well as the appearance of a mysterious figure that seems to know of his brother. This reasons compel Max to seek out the Legion threat, hoping in the process to also find his missing brother.",

Miss Peaches doesn't like dogs, and sees them as a way of making money, by dog-napping Daisy the pedigree dog. \n \nThe dog elements are closely integrated into the game - smells are indicated by lines of coloured smoke, emphasising a dog's acute sense of smell. Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans. \n \nJake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.",

The IPCA agents foil the ALA's plans. Mujari is recovered and under medical care. \n \nMeanwhile, Stone discovers that Cosa Nostra want to retrieve the virus to use it as a tool in mafia wars. So Stone went on a mission to Pescara to assassinate the mafia head, Dimitri Alexoupolos. Dimitri's assassination prevented a Mafia family from gaining access to Syphon Filter.",

The Island, a massive fragment of a long-lost planet, hurtling blindly through space. Upon the surface of this paradise wanders the giant, Kabuto. Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers. In their pride, they created Kabuto, as a defense against intruders. But Kabuto became conscious of himself, his loneliness, his pain - and he went berserk.\n\nSpace castaways, the Meccs piloted their ship through space, looking for their missing friends. If you haven\u2019t guessed already, they ended up on the Island. Faced with yet another unscheduled layover while on their way to Planet Majorca, the Meccs decide to make the best of their temporary home. Just their luck - the natives are already embroiled in their own little war, and the Mecc visitors are most unwelcome!\n\nMeccaryns... Sea Reapers... Kabuto... One island isn\u2019t big enough for the three of them.",

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.\n\nKingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.\n\nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.",

As a Hunter, you have the special gift--or curse--to recognize and destroy the evil that has come back from the dead to dwell the earth. This time, an evil cult has formed in Ashcroft and it's up to Hunters to destroy it. Choose from five playable characters--each with unique weapons, edges, and supernatural abilities--and fight crowds of monstrous enemies.

This hotel of the undead is filled with a bizarre group of guests -- along with Gregory and a mischievous little punk kid called James. Your goal is to steal the soul fragment (contained in milk bottles) that each guest holds. Doing so will, as Death informed you, get you out of the hotel, and apparently fill you in on why you were out walking about in the forest in the first place. You obtain the soul fragments by interacting with guests and solving basic puzzles. The game ends when you've run out of spirit as indicated by a spirit meter.",

        "storyline": "The game begins with Vetch (voiced by Steve Tarlow) receiving a transmission from his lieutenant, Overlord (Jason Gregory), who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice. Rather than kill Haven, Vetch decides to watch him, hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage. Meanwhile, in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra, Haven (Jake Rosewall-Gallagher) is completing his latest invention; a mechanical bird named Talon. Upon finishing, Haven heads to work in the mines. However, upon entering, he sees his friend Chess (Regan Kerwan) being questioned by a guard. The guard tries to shoot Haven, but misses, and causes the mine to collapse, knocking out Haven.\n\nHe awakens under the treatment of Dr. Spong (Andrew Silber), who tells him Chess hasn't been seen since the collapse. Setting out to find her, he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle, as they planned. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams. She refuses to tell him anything, and Haven intervenes, killing Overlord and freeing Chess. They escape, and Chess says that while in detention, she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes. Haven decides he must speak to this slave.\n\nHaven heads to the Isle of Heroes, and meets the Wise Man (Terry Bertram). He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain, and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice; Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years, and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, he was unable to even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, he left behind the Golden Bell, but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote. Making the people of Aurias his slaves, he sealed off the Mount of Sighs, on which resides the Golden Voice. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias, the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash, and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount.\n\nHaven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. However, as he escapes Firash, he is captured and placed in the Sylex, a space station prison. He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco, a planet populated by lizard-like humanoids. He soon meets brothers Chill (Dale Stump) and Will (Aubrey Hodges). They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoid-like creatures. Haven does so, however, the insect queen attacks the local village. Haven defeats her, and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer. He then heads to Auria.\n\nHe makes it to the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess. She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlord's castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves. Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven.\n\nThey pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship, and the duo escape. However, Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along, who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.\n\nHaven escapes, but is unable to free Chess, and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone, promising to return for Chess. He returns to the Mount of Sighs, where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead. He then kills Athellion. Haven confronts him, but Vetch defeats him. However, the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive. As such, Vetch ties Haven to a rock, pointing out \"you can't live forever\" and leaves him alone on the planet. The game ends on this cliffhanger.", 
        "summary": "The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.",

However Achille proves too powerful and strikes down Maximo with one blast of his dark magic, killing him. Now floating in the underworld, Maximo is approached by Grim who reveals that Achille is drilling into the underworld to harvest souls, fueling his undead army.

The game now got some different part since the player has to manage the eatery and the waitresses, all of whom are lovely and potential love interests. During each week he has to decide about the coffee shop menus, the prices, what will be the waitress duties during that week and also what he is going to do that week (he can study management, rest, etc.). There are some times during each week that the player is giving some choices (like in all visual novel adventures) and depending of them the game ending will be different. If he got success he can buy new coffee shops, new waitress dresses, etc.",

        "storyline": "God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army. \nKratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos. \n \nAfter a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue.", 
        "summary": "God of War II is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released for the PlayStation 2 console on March 13, 2007, it is the second installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically, and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal, and take revenge on Zeus. \n \nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installment. It focuses on combo-based combat which is achieved through the player's main weapon\u2014Athena's Blades\u2014and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require players to quickly complete various game controller actions to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared to its predecessor, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses. \n \nGod of War II has been acclaimed as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games, and was 2007's \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 2009, IGN listed it as the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, and both IGN and GameSpot consider it the \"swan song\" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2012, Complex magazine named God of War II the best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It was the best-selling game in the UK during the week of its release and went on to sell 4.24 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. God of War II, along with God of War, was remastered and released on November 17, 2009 as part of the God of War Collection for the PlayStation 3. The remastered version was re-released on August 28, 2012 as part of the God of War Saga, also for the PlayStation 3. A novelization of the game was published in February 2013. \n \nThe European/Australian PAL version was released as two different editions: a single-disc standard edition and a two-disc \"Special Edition\" with different box art and a bonus DVD.",

        "storyline": "Two years after defeating Clockwerk, Sly Cooper breaks into the Museum of Natural History in Cairo to steal the Clockwerk parts and destroy them to end his threat against Sly's family for good, but discovers that the parts are already missing. Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox and her new partner, Constable Neyla, confront Sly, but he escapes before Carmelita and Neyla can arrest him. Before making his escape, Sly hears Neyla suggest that the evidence actually suggests that the Klaww Gang stole the parts for their own use.\n\nThe Cooper Gang heads to Paris, where the first Klaww Gang member Dimitri is using Clockwerk tail feathers as printing plates to create counterfeit money. Sly and the gang shut the operation down and Dimitri is arrested by Interpol. The gang then heads to India, where the second Klaww Gang member Rajan puts Clockwerk's wings on display at a ball he is hosting. Rajan is also the kingpin of a local crime syndicate that grows and sells \"spice\", an illegal plant indigenous to the Indian jungle. Also present at the ball are the other Klaww Gang members and several undercover Interpol agents, including Carmelita and Neyla. The gang steals the Clockwerk wings in the middle of the ballroom while a disguised Sly creates a distraction by dancing with Carmelita. After the Cooper gang escapes with the Clockwerk wings, Carmelita blows her cover and starts making arrests. The Klaww Gang flees the scene, and Rajan goes into hiding somewhere deep in the jungle. The gang tracks him to his spice-growing facility in a long-abandoned temple, where he is using half of Clockwerk heart to super-irrigate his spice crops. He carries the other half of the heart on the end of a staff that he carries with him at all times. The gang steals both halves of the heart and incapacitates Rajan, but Carmelita, Neyla and the Contessa arrive. Neyla frames Carmelita of working with the Cooper Gang on the night the Clockwerk wings were stolen. She betrays the Cooper Gang and puts Sly, Murray, and Carmelita under arrest.", 
        "summary": "The sequel to Sly Cooper delivers the same crime detective style of presentation, borrowing heavily from movies, novels and comic books to create a beautiful, highly animated game. The story takes place two years after Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. In the first game, Sly was becoming a professional thief, but in Band of Thieves, he is a professional thief -- so he retains all of the moves from the first game. He also earns new moves and gains different items to assist him in his dark craft. The biggest upgrade comes in form of the new multi-character gameplay. Players might start a level as Sly, and then after completing a particular task, players switch to Bentley, and Murray, respectively.",

For example while in human form, sing a song only dogs could appreciate, causing those nearby to drop coins that must be collected. Catch them all as these coins are what Cosmi and his enemies are being judged on in order to return home.\n\nBut beware; causing such disruption puts Cosmi in danger of being caught and having his true alien identity revealed.",

As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the anime series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home.\n\nThis is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters.",

Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.",

A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.\n\nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.\n\nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.\n\nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.\n\nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.",

It is divided into three realms - heaven, home to white-winged angels; the human world, inhabited by relatively weak, wingless people; and hell, where black-winged devils reside. The three realms are largely independent and their natives are suspicious of the other realms. Many humans have been convinced of the evil nature of Hell by the angels, but for all their fearsome powers neither the devils nor Hell itself are inherently malevolent. Hell is ruled by the beautiful and compassionate Jenarose, who is said to love humankind more than anyone in the world.", 
        "summary": "Rage was one of the four Great Generals of the Demon Army, but he was slain in a battle against the Angels. He has recently been revived, but has lost all memories of his previous life. With the war between Demons and Angels still continuing with no end in sight, he must restore his power and build his forces back up to strike back against the Angel Army.\n\nBlack/Matrix II is a turn-based tactical strategy game similar in structure to Final Fantasy Tactics, and the sequel to Black/Matrix. Characters level up and learn abilities individually, and it is possible to recruit a variety of characters, though only 6 at a time can be deployed into a battle. There are also several different romantic interests to pursue, with multiple endings for each depending on the player's choices throughout the game.",

One day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon he discovers that the groom Xelpherpolis has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell. \n \nEphemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific location at a specific time.",

You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.\n\nGrandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.",

The remake was developed by ArtePiazza and Matrix Software, the former of which would go on to supervise remakes of nearly each title in the series for the Nintendo DS and 3DS.\n\nIt features 3D graphics that are similar in style to Dragon Quest VII, but it utilizes the extra PlayStation 2 graphical capabilities for more detailed polygonal models and textures and the soundtrack was performed by the NHK Symphony. The remake actually uses an earlier version of the DQVIII engine developed by Level-5, making the only instance of a hardware's remake title launching before the next main entry. In addition to truly bringing the series into the third dimension after the limited scope of the seventh game, the PS2 remake of Dragon Quest V also adjusted the scenario and balance of the game.",

Pinon PakaPuka is a white haired kid who would rather read and study than practice swordplay, go to school, or make friends. He is often compared to his father, Pietro, because everyone expects him to be as great as Pietro was when he was young, but Pinon hates the fact everyone is expecting too much from him. He meets the aqua haired girl named Luna after she saves him from drowning. Luna seems to know about Pinon, and Pinon doesn't know how.",

Using the Pengel (pronounced \"pen-jell\") as a cursor, the player simply sketches out the limbs, body, and other features. Depending on the amount of magic ink expended, and the types of body parts, the creature will be given certain statistics and created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.",

        "storyline": "The story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.\n\nDespite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly\u2014his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.\n\nUrged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been \"possessed by the dead\", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor\u2014a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.\n\nAfterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces\u2014the colossi\u2014to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.\n\nIn the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.",

        "storyline": "Lupine III and his inseparable companions Jigen and Goemon run to the rescue of the beautiful Fujiko who got into a big trouble: the woman was in fact kidnapped by the band of the Celestial Dragon at whose command is the ruthless Kourin, a terrible twenty year old with incomparable techniques of struggle and powerful performer of mysterious martial arts, which hits Lupine in a vital point with the deadly Dark blow, leaving the thief gentleman only three days of life. In order to save himself, Lupine must get hold of Sokai's treasure (it is said that there is a cure in the treasure that could heal from the dark blow), through a series of clues written in the Book, aka the Pink Crystals (accompanied by the Black Crystals in the second narrative strand of the game), which however are the prize up for the winner of the Miss Sokai competition. Fujiko signs up for the beauty contest, but a problem arises: it is the beautiful Ginrei, a girl so charming that she even arouses admiration of the impassive Goemon. As if this were not enough, the inspector Koichi Zenigata, bitter enemy of Lupine III, senses that the next target of the protagonist will be the Pink Crystals and then rushes to Ginrei to warn her about Lupine and to supervise her in order to keep her safe . The first encounter between Zenigata and Ginrei is not the best: she invites him to leave her alone because the young woman is convinced that she is out of any danger, while he considers her a vain girl and dad's daughter (not knowing that in reality the young it comes from the outskirts of Sokai, a very unreliable and above all very poor neighborhood).\n\nLupine, meanwhile, fearing that Ginrei could steal the title of winner from Fujiko, plans to sneak into the girl's hotel to secretly give her a dose of sleeping pill that will make her sleep for two days. But since Zenigata was there to guard the girl, the gentleman thief was tracked down twice (first in the restaurant where Zazz\u00e0 and the girl had dinner, then in the young girl's apartment after Lupine had managed to escape all the policemen who were patrol), but both times he quickly manages to escape. In the meantime, the relationship between Ginrei and Zenigata is notably changing: between the two an agreement begins to arise, Zaz\u00e0 no longer thinks that the young woman is only a presumptuous egoist, while the latter sees in the inspector a figure that protects her and who is always present next to her in times of need. In other words, the spark of love began to ignite.\n\nThe day of Miko's competition arrives: Fujiko and Ginrei parade on the catwalk with elegance and, above all, unparalleled seduction. But between the two it is Fujiko to tick it, undoubtedly more loose and sexy than the opponent, decidedly more shy and reserved. Armed then with pink crystals and the blessed Miko (Fujiko), Lupine and the woman hurry to reach the Government Palace of Sokai where the treasure is said to be hidden. The protagonist escapes all the traps and deadly traps hidden by the building; Meanwhile Zenigata tries to improvise a speech to herself to console Ginrei, when suddenly she feels that she is talking to Kourin, the architect of the Dark Strike who sentenced Lupine to only three days of life. Zazz\u00e0 discovers that Kourin is none other than Ginrei's brother, who wanted his sweet sister to win Miko's contest in order to obtain the Pink Crystals that will lead the terrible boy to Sokai's treasure. The inspector bursts into the room where Kourin and Ginrei are conversing, but the boss of the Celestial Dragon treacherously shoots the poor Zenigata, who fortunately manages to save himself thanks to the bulletproof vest he had worn to protect, if necessary, Ginrei. Kourin thus rushes to the Government Palace to prevent Lupine from taking possession of the treasure; the head of the celestial dragon reaches Fujiko and the protagonist, and informs the latter of the fact that the medicine capable of healing him from the Dark Strike is the so-called Fog Flower, a flower, in fact, capable of totally eliminating the effects of the terrible kill shot. To prevent the thief from continuing further, however, Kourin strikes Fujiko with the tremendous Dark Strike, unleashing the wrath of Lupine who, furious as ever, kills the boss of the Celestial Dragon gang through the blows of his infallible Walther P38 (in the second the final of the saga, instead is Zenigata to finish Kourin, to avenge the sufferings that the latter caused to his sister Ginrei).\n\nLupine thus manages to take over the flower of fog, making Fujiko drink the only purifying drop, which recovers and can barely see the smiling face of the thief, who falls apparently lifeless to the ground. Fortunately, the woman kisses the protagonist to thank him for saving her life,",
