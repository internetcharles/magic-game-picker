When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years. During his incarceration, Kiryu is expelled from his organization, the Tojo Clan, and Yumi goes missing. After his release, he learns that ten billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan's private bank, and that the entire Japanese underworld is now searching for the lost wealth.", 
        "summary": "Just as Kazuma, a former rising star in the Yakuza, emerges from prison after a murder cover-up, 10 billion yen vanishes from the Yakuza vault, forcing him once again into their brutal, lawless world. A mysterious young girl will lead Kazuma to the answers if he can keep her alive.",

        "storyline": "The story mode in Budokai 3 takes place on a world map called Dragon Universe. This mode consists of 11 playable characters traveling around Earth or Namek during the four main sagas of Dragon Ball Z: Saiyan Saga, Frieza Saga, Cell Saga, and Majin Buu Saga, while collecting items such as money, capsules, Dragon Balls or unlocking other characters for use in the other game modes. The various characters are each unlocked by completing a required task within Dragon Universe (for example, Dr. Gero is unlocked by defeating Dr. Gero with Yamcha in the Androids Saga).\n\nThe Dragon Universe has a high level of replayability due to events in the game potentially changing from playthrough-to-playthrough. For example, in Goku's first playthrough the majority of the story proceeds as it does according to the anime. However, in the following playthroughs, certain choices can include Goku's fight with Frieza changing into a fight with Cooler instead. These choices can even lead to events such as fighting Broly and Omega Shenron after fighting Super Buu. With eleven characters available for play in Story Mode, and various choices available for each character, Dragon Universe has significantly more replay value than previous Budokai games.", 
        "summary": "The third installment in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai series begins another tournament of champions where only one fighter can prevail. As one of the characters from the Dragon Ball Z animated series, you can master an all-new fighting system that lets you teleport, juggle opponents, fly, and attack in a variety of ways. As you progress through the tournament, you can unlock up to 40 bonus characters from the DBZ universe. You can also post and retrieve character profiles from the Internet.",

Afterwards, Ultraman then crushes the two rocks that Bullton left behind. Later, Ultraman confronts and battles the ancient monster, Gomora. After a quick battle, Gomora tries to escape but Ultraman grabs his tail to stop him, which forces Gomora to detach it before burrowing underground. Red King then appears and attacks Ultraman from behind. Engaging in a violent battle, Ultraman defeats Red King and flies away. Suddenly, a mysterious UFO uses a purple mist on Red King. Meanwhile, Ultraseven battles Eleking at a dam and manages to defeat the monster. Unfortunately, the purple mist appears again and changes Eleking into EX Eleking. Despite the monster's increased power, Ultraseven defeats EX Eleking. The mysterious UFO then flies away. \n \nLater that night, in another city, Ultraman Tiga duels with Kyrieloid. However, Kyrieloid escapes to a cave. There, Ultraman Tiga finds the injured and sleeping Gomora, who awakens and attacks him. After battling him, the monster, still weak from his fight with Ultraman, decides to retreat. Suddenly, Gomora is then killed by Chaos Kyrieloid. Though he had evolved, Ultraman Tiga defeats Chaos Kyrieloid. Ultraman Taro fights the rampaging Tyrant in the city, defeating him after a brutal battle. Taro then quickly heads to a volcano, where he battles with EX Red King. The EX monster is defeated by Taro. Later, Ultraman Cosmos arrives to stop a rampaging Gomora, who has been turned into EX Gomora. However, the military attempted to kill EX Gomora, which Cosmos tries to prevent as he only wants to calm Gomora. Fortunately, Ultraman Cosmos uses his Luna Extract to return him back to Gomora. Gomora then leaves in peace.",

The player battles as the Ultra Warriors in stories identical to TV show episodes and movies. \n \nThe game features a ranking system, in which depending on how well the player completed the stage, they will be awarded a rank, with D being the worst rank and S being the best rank. Each stage has its own health and time remaining requirement, that when completed boosts the rank. Two other special tasks must be completed to achieve an S Rank. Lots of stages include more than 2 special tasks, meaning there are multiple ways to get an S rank for each stage. Some of these tasks can achieve an S rank immediately, regardless of any other special tasks or the health and time requirements.",

The main story mode is \"Decade Mode\", where the player must complete various missions with different characters to proceed through the story. There are also standard Versus, Survival, and Training modes. The game also includes a simple control option for younger players.",

Will it be Lau Chan, Kage-Maru, Wolf Hawkfield, Jeffry McWild, Akira Yuki, Jacky Bryant, Sarah Bryant, or Pai Chan? The answer lies within. Immerse yourself in this technically challenging game and see if you have what it takes to be the champion of the second World Fighting Tournament!\n\nOn paper, the PlayStation 2 version of Virtua Fighter II mirrors its arcade counterpart exactly. The people who worked on this port were clearly aiming for an arcade perfect title. The game apparently reads the controller at the same frequency as the arcade, 57.5 times per second. Purists who demand perfect timing for their combos should be in heaven. The resolution of the arcade has also been replicated, with VF2 running on the PS2 in 496x384 resolution. This leaves black bars around the game, but you can select to zoom up to full screen in the options menu of you want. The game offers up arcade, versus and ranking modes of play, all playable using either version 2.0 or 2.1 settings (selectable in the options menu).",

In Resembool, Edward and Alphonse meet an enigmatic alchemist named Jack Crowley and an entity called the Phantom. It seems that they have some connection with both the disappearances and the strange creatures (known as Golems) appearing around the countryside. When sends the brothers and to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis. Edward and Alphonse soon find themselves headed for the ruins of Siam-Sid, the capital city of Lebis, to discover the truth behind the Golems and the puzzling disappearances.", 
        "summary": "Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir is the third Fullmetal Alchemist video game for the PlayStation 2 and is the second Fullmetal Alchemist console role-playing game for the PlayStation 2. It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of Season 2 (episodes 27 Teacher and 28 One is all, All is One\") of the 2003 anime series, since the show took a 4 month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the 2nd OP \"READY STEADY GO\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel and the shortened 3rd ED \"Motherland\" by Crystal Kay, since that is the version that was to be shown in the Adult Swim broadcast. As of August 31, 2005, the game has sold 160 thousand units in Japan.",

The actual tournament follows over five days in which cut sequences telling the character's story are interspersed with matches. These are elimination-based, but there's the option to instantly replay a match that has been lost. The second day always features a mud match, and the fourth is usually a match of special significance, involving a shocking revelation or an encounter with a rival. The climax comes in a final boss fight against the mysterious Lady X and the resolution of the character's story. \n \nDefeating Lady X unlocks a new alternate story mode, featuring the characters alter-ego. It may be supposed that this takes place some time later after the character has 'turned'. In this mode, there are cut sequences only at the start and finish of the character's story. In between she fights a number of matches against various opponents (including one mud wrestling). The final match begins with a cut sequence, and is usually against a special rival (though in a few cases its Lady X again) and winning this match completes the story. It also unlocks a new costume.",

WWX: Rumble Rose delivers intense girl-on-girl wrestling action with an all-female roster of vixens--each with specialty moves. The combat system lets you humiliate your opponents through insults, taunting, and aggressive moves and holds. Your player's costume, attitude, and wrestling style change depending on whether you fight dirty or fair. Naughty or nice, becoming a popular wrestler will earn benefits, including expanded gameplay, additional skills and moves, and more-revealing and flamboyant costumes.",

Fourteen characters are available initially, but a total of twenty-four can be unlocked over the course of play, including long-time Capcom superstars Mega Man and Zero. With the addition of items and weapons strewn around the battle field which characters can pick up to aid in battle, gameplay is aptly compared to one of Capcom's other fighting franchises, Power Stone.",

        "summary": "The sequel to Dynasty Tactics gives the player more tactics to choose from, and introduces some new characters and features.\n\nLike in the first game, the player assumes the role of 3 important leaders in ancient China: Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Ce. A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.\n\nFor battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game).\n\nMorale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale.\n\nThe game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.",

Whereas in Dynasty Warriors, however, Koei focuses on ancient Chinese history, Devil Kings focuses more on feudal Japan, but with a fictional setting with the ability to use modern day weapons such as chain guns and shotguns as well as fighting legendary and fictional characters from the past.\n\nThe story takes place as the Devil King, a king possessed by the soul of the Devil, has unleashed an unholy army on the world to bend it to his will as the player must stop him along with many of his minions including his wife Lady Butterfly, his general the Red Minotaur, as well as loyal assassins Scorpio and Venus.\n\nThe gameplay is more arcade hack-and-slash style, with the ability of using magic spells to wipe out entire waves of enemies and as mentioned before, the ability to use modern day weapons along with historical weapons such as spears, swords among others. There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).",

The soundtracks for each game are from the arcade version, with the exception of Alpha 2 Gold, which uses the arranged soundtrack from the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions. The original Alpha gives player a choice between CP System and CPS II-style soundtracks (the former is based on the CPS Changer version of the game).\n\nAll the games in the compilation includes the standard Arcade, Versus and Training modes, as well as Survival mode and Dramatic Battle for the Alpha games. The Dramatic Battle mode featured in the original Alpha, Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 Gold is the same one featured in the Japanese arcade version of Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, allowing players to create their own team of characters and fight against a specific series of opponents (Adon, Sagat, M. Bison and Akuma). The original Dramatic Battle mode from the first Alpha, which features Ryu and Ken against Bison, is still available in the game as a secret feature.",

The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?\n\nBloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called \"DNA points,\" which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.",

        "storyline": "Gekibo 2 is the sequel to Gekisha Boy. It is a fast-paced side-scrolling game where the player controls the junior photographer Pete Goldman working for the newspaper Planet Times in Japan. In each stage the goal is to photograph as many weird or funny situations as they occur in the environment while the screen scrolls to the right automatically. The player has minor control over the character's movement as the focus is on moving the cursor used to snap pictures. It is possible to capture any part of the environment and pictures are lined up in the bottom right side of the screen. Correctly captured gags and unusual situations remain there, while the others fly away and are discarded. A score is built up based on the performance.\n\nThis second game uses a different graphical style, replacing the flat 2D design with full 3D stages allowing for vertical movement while the characters are cut-out sprites similar to PaRappa the Rapper. This 3D depth introduces a new function where it becomes possible to zoom in on action in the background. It is now also possible to lock the cursor, useful to line up shots while avoiding hazards. A flash ability that clears the entire screen removes all obstacles such as a skateboard for instance, but can also reveal secrets such as hidden scenes and areas, and even completely new levels. It can only be used a few times per level shown through the number of bulbs available in the bottom left corner.\n\nSnapping situations provide film rolls that act as \"ammo\" that can be picked up and are required to keep on photographing. Often quick reflexes are needed so as not to miss situations or to avoid obstacles. Compared to the first game the amount of film is more generous, but the action is now much faster. Collisions with hazards can also be avoided using a new dash move or by snapping them. Some of the locations in the game are The Ginza, theme park Harajuku, spooky spot Odaiba, downtown Katsushika, gynmnasium Yoyogi, the historic town Tsukiji and the zoo in Ueno. There are three difficulty levels.\n\nPhotographs are stored in an album as a way to get an overview of every possible scenario to capture. There is support for the PlayStation Printer peripheral where the front page of a newspaper can be printed with one of your pictures in a prominent position. Pictures from the album can be printed as well. Picture Paradise is supported too, allowing players to use a camera to insert themselves into the game. That way the game can be personalized by giving random pedestrians the faces of friends or family members.",
