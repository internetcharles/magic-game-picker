The setting of the game takes place during summer vacation and the player adopts the persona of a boy with a fascination for insects. A rascally blue-haired girl plays the part of a rival that is also collecting specimens for the lab and barging in on your action.",

Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush.\nSamba de Amigo \u2013 Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.\nChuChu Rocket! \u2013 Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.\nPuyo Pop Fever \u2013 Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.\nCrazy Taxi \u2013 Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.\nSuper Monkey Ball \u2013 The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.\nNiGHTS Into Dreams \u2013 NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.\nHouse of the Dead \u2013 A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.\nVirtua Striker \u2013 As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.\nVirtua Fighter \u2013 Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.\nSpace Channel 5 \u2013 Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.\nBilly Hatcher and the Giant Egg \u2013 By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.",

Though there are only six games in the series, various ports and international releases are included, bringing the total number of releases included to 16. Also included are artwork galleries, instruction manuals and Japanese/overseas variants (bar the English version of Wonder Boy in Monster Land). With the exception of both versions of Wonder Boy in Monster Land and Monster World IV all of the versions of the games included are playable in English or have a separate English release included for the same console (for example, the Game Gear releases and Wonder Boy in Monster World's Mega Drive release).\n\nInterestingly, the Sega Master System version of Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is included in this collection, despite never being released in Japan. The game nevertheless supports the FM Sound Unit add-on, meaning this is the first time the general public could hear this game with its FM soundtrack (without resorting to emulation).",

Immerse yourself in this technically challenging game and see if you have what it takes to be the champion of the second World Fighting Tournament!\n\nOn paper, the PlayStation 2 version of Virtua Fighter II mirrors its arcade counterpart exactly. The people who worked on this port were clearly aiming for an arcade perfect title. The game apparently reads the controller at the same frequency as the arcade, 57.5 times per second. Purists who demand perfect timing for their combos should be in heaven. The resolution of the arcade has also been replicated, with VF2 running on the PS2 in 496x384 resolution. This leaves black bars around the game, but you can select to zoom up to full screen in the options menu of you want. The game offers up arcade, versus and ranking modes of play, all playable using either version 2.0 or 2.1 settings (selectable in the options menu).",

The 100 top scorers will be recognized through an interactive ranking system, letting novice players test their dancing mettle against top-notch DDR experts. Players can also go online to access new challenge missions which will be refreshed periodically, allowing players a way to continually expand the DDR gaming experience. Whether players are looking to dance to the hottest tracks in town, choreograph, edit and create their own dance steps, or use the 'Work Out' mode to burn off excess pounds, DDR Extreme 2 will offer players of all ages an interactive and fun way to get up and groove. The game's support for the EyeToy Camera continues to add depth and dimension to the gameplay. While using the camera, players can access fast-paced mini games and use both their hands and feet while dancing and watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music, including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as \"Genie In A Bottle\" and \"Oops!...I Did It Again.\" Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.",

This version features a bonus DVD including an exclusive training mode (\"Starter's Guide\") and a documentary covering history of previous Hokuto no Ken titles for home consoles.

The 100 top scorers will be recognized through an interactive ranking system, letting novice players test their dancing mettle against top-notch DDR experts. Players can also go online to access new challenge missions which will be refreshed periodically, allowing players a way to continually expand the DDR gaming experience. Whether players are looking to dance to the hottest tracks in town, choreograph, edit and create their own dance steps, or use the 'Work Out' mode to burn off excess pounds, DDR STR!KE will offer players of all ages an interactive and fun way to get up and groove. The game's support for the EyeToy Camera continues to add depth and dimension to the gameplay. While using the camera, players can access fast-paced mini games and use both their hands and feet while dancing and watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music, including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as \"Genie In A Bottle\" and \"Oops!...I Did It Again.\" Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.",

The version of Alpha 2 Gold allows player to select Cammy in all the game modes, including the single-player Arcade Mode (in which she is given her own storyline and ending), not just Versus and Training. The soundtracks for each game are from the arcade version, with the exception of Alpha 2 Gold, which uses the arranged soundtrack from the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions. The original Alpha gives player a choice between CP System and CPS II-style soundtracks (the former is based on the CPS Changer version of the game).\n\nAll the games in the compilation includes the standard Arcade, Versus and Training modes, as well as Survival mode and Dramatic Battle for the Alpha games. The Dramatic Battle mode featured in the original Alpha, Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 Gold is the same one featured in the Japanese arcade version of Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, allowing players to create their own team of characters and fight against a specific series of opponents (Adon, Sagat, M. Bison and Akuma). The original Dramatic Battle mode from the first Alpha, which features Ryu and Ken against Bison, is still available in the game as a secret feature.",

An elite pilot using the codename Mobius 1 is sent on a number of missions to fight Eruseans and help ISAF to win the war. While performing those missions, Mobius 1 begins to learn about the impact war has on civilians, and the pilots of the opposing side.",

It allows the player to participate in semi-realistic dog-fighting with a collection of fighter jets, including the F-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-117 Nighthawk, U-2 Dragon Lady, C-130 Hercules and SR-71 Blackbird. Eighteen missions will take the player from search-and-destroy buildings to one-on-one and all-on-all dog-fighting. Along the way it becomes possible to upgrade the fighter with defense systems, deadly weapons, and other accessories.",

        "summary": "EyeToy: Play is a video game for the PlayStation 2, released in 2003. It was the first game to make use of the PlayStation 2's video camera accessory, EyeToy. The game was initially packaged with the EyeToy when the accessory was first released. It features twelve mini-games to choose from. This game, and all other EyeToy titles, are played by moving one's body. The motion is detected by the USB camera. The software recognizes pixel changes in the video image and compares the proximity of the change to other game objects to play the game. Users who get a high score get to take a photo to tease other players.",
