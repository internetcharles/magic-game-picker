A mysterious voice contacts him and says that this world is called Endonesia, and if he wants to return home, he has to call upon its fifty gods. In order to find the gods, the hero has to communicate with the inhabitants of Endnesia by transferring his own emotions to others.\n\nCreated by Taro Kudo and Kazuyuki Kurashima of Love-de-lic fame, Endnesia is one of the spiritual descendants (along with Giftpia and Chulip) of their seminal game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. Like those other games, Endnesia is a puzzle-solving adventure with RPG elements such as statistics, item-gathering, and character growth.\n\nThe theme of the game is sharing emotions; gameplay-wise, it translates into puzzle-solving which involves using the right emotion on the right characters at the right time. For example, using the Hunger emotion on an animal will make it hungry, urging it to find food, which will clear the path for the hero.\n\nSimilarly to Moon and its descendants, Endnesia has a day-night cycle. The hero's health meter is depleted due to exhaustion; though the game's world is quite large, the player always has a time limit for his daily activities. The player should also feed the hero; hunger makes his vision blurry and slows down his pace.",

        "storyline": "Sixty-seven years after the events of the Subterranean Era in prior games, Earth's second largest corporation, Zio Matrix, acquires plans for a research project on Mars, dating back before the Great Destruction. Using these plans, Zio sends a research team to Mars to begin the Terraforming Project, which causes the Martian surface and atmosphere to approximate that of Earth. Other corporations learn of the project and quickly follow Zio Matrix, bringing with them the competitive environment that existed on Earth, and the employ of the mercenaries of Nerves Concord.\n\nAs the three companies' war comes to a close, the most powerful, Zio Matrix, attempts a coup against the government, which has regained control through its elite mercenary team, The Frighteners, led by Leos Klein. But in the chaos that ensues, the Frighteners turn on the government, assassinate the new leader of the LCC, and take control of powerful Disorder technology. The player character is tasked with confronting them and saving the human populace of Mars.", 
        "summary": "The genuine sequel to the original Armored Core. Thrown into the world of AC mechs, you must complete the objectives set for you by a range of different companies, each with a hefty pay packet attached. If the mission is completed, the money goes towards upgrades and repairs to your mech.\n\nThe collection of items to upgrade your mech is fully stocked with weapons, defense systems, rocket packs and guidance systems to increase accuracy and speed. Certain missions require a particular upgrade for the mission to be completed correctly, so spending the cash wisely is important to your career.\n\nOnce your mech is ready for battle, you can also take on a friend in arena mode, where one-on-one battles rage on for as long as you wish in huge outdoor areas.",

Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.",

This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises. \n \nPresented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.",

In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.",

The game differs from Monopoly in that players can buy and sell stocks of a block, affecting the value of block's stock up by buying or down by selling that block's stock or by developing a player-owned property of that block which increases the value per share for that block's stock. Also unlike Monopoly, it is not necessary to own the entire block to develop a property, though controlling more than one property of a block allows the player to develop their properties into larger buildings to collect more from opponents when they land on them. Players must collect a set of four suits, heart, diamond, clover and spade, to level up and collect additional gold when the pass the starting position/bank. To win a player must make it back to the bank with the board's required amount, which includes the total value of the player's stocks, property value, and gold on hand.",

        "summary": "The second game in the The Chikyuu Boueigun series, renamed Global Defence Force for its English release (similarly the first game was renamed Monster Attack for its English release).\n\nIt's been two years since the invading alien menace was defeated by the Global Defence Force (the game renames the \"Earth Defence Force\" from the previous game), but like any good off-world threat, they're back for more, and they've brought new weapons and technology in their attempts to take Earth and eliminate humanity. Thankfully, the GDF has also been developing new technology to fight them.\n\nGlobal Defence Force is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an GDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character's maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively.\n\nBeyond adding a second player class to choose from; the Pale Wing; a fragile but powerful melee centric character with a limited Jetpack and her own weapon set, to go alongside the infantry man of the first game, Global Defence Force doesn't change much of the basic game play of Monster Attack. But leaving at that would undersell the game; there are numerous new alien types, weapons and environments that add much more variety to things. The maps are larger and more detailed and missions are longer and much more scripted (where as the original game nearly always threw you into an environment against some preplaced bug's, this time you often have some simple objective(s)) to add further variety. Finally the physics have been notably enhanced.\n\nLike Monster Attack, the player in Global Defence Force fights completely by themselves despite being part of an army (unless playing offline only 2 player split screen); the original Japanese version features radio chatter from other GDF squads and your commanding officer, to give the illusion that you are fighting alongside others. This was cut from the English release.",

The main character, Chihiro Enomoto, was chosen by lot as a candidate for the next student council, and he and his partner had to undergo rigorous training and trials in order to become a member of the next student council.\n\nThe main part of the game is a 3D action that goes through an automatically generated dungeon in Ryubashiin Gakuen. If you choose one of your favorite characters before the start of the stage, subcharacters will follow and you will move on to the stage with a total of three people. A partner may initially be in a blunt \"tsun\" state, but regaining a damaged partner can increase his/her popularity, and a \"dere\" state can give him/her an advantage in the progress of the game.",

There is also a View mode where the various animations that play on the in-game display can be freely viewed. There is no story mode.",
