        "storyline": ".hack//G.U. takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the year 2017. As depicted in the first .hack game series, the \"2nd Network Crisis\" was an incident that occurred seven years ago in which many computer systems across Japan malfunctioned. Through the efforts of those games' hero, Kite, the incident resulted in the birth of Aura, the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making decisions for itself. Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period.\n\nIn late 2014, Aura disappears, resulting in the slow decay of The World and the Internet as a whole. In response, the company that administrates The World, CC Corp, sets up \"Project G.U.\" and tasks them with remedying the problem. They come up with the \"Restore Aura (RA) Plan\", in which they attempt to retrieve the fragments of Morganna\u2014an AI that served as Aura's \"mother\"\u2014and seal them into player characters (PCs) of The World. In theory, this would allow the Project G.U. programmers to manipulate the Morganna program to recreate Aura. Only certain \"chosen\" players could control these special \"Epitaph PCs\".\n\nAfter locating candidates to operate the Epitaph PCs, the team proceeds to test the RA Plan despite concerns over \"anti-existences\" that might damage the Internet. The program fails catastrophically and destroys over 80% of the data for The World.[9] Instead of trying to salvage the data, CC Corp develops The World R:2 and releases it to a new generation of players. However, this new game is less popular than its predecessor and becomes plagued by \"player killers\" (PKs), players who target other players for fun and sport. The Epitaph PCs which had been lost during the RA Plan disaster resurface in the new version, attached to certain players of interest.\n\nVol. 3: Redemption\nBy Redemption Yata is forcibly removed from the Serpent of Lore by CC Corp Executives and replaced with Sakaki, after promising CC Corp to remove the threat of AIDA against the greater networks. Sakaki forces Haseo into a PK tournament that is corrupted by AIDA. Haseo has no choice but to fight in the tournament and defeat Sakaki. Later, Haseo and the others find Yata who is revealed as the seventh Epitaph user with Ovan being the eighth.\n\nBo meets Ovan's sister, Aina, which leads Ovan to inviting Haseo to another fight. Haseo goes to the area with G.U. and defeat him. After the battle Ovan uses his Avatar's special ability known as \"The Rebirth\" and completely resets the Internet and cleanse it of AIDA. The G.U. members are saved by Zelkova, leader of Moon Tree, who reveals that Ovan's actions caused several comatose players to wake up. The other unconscious player's minds still lie within The World and Yata discovers a creature named Cubia that is trying to devour the game, resulting in the death of all players.\n\nHaseo uses his Avatar powers to summon the goddess Aura who hints to them that the key to defeating Cubia is the eight Avatars. Since Haseo has defeated all of the others Avatars in battle, he possesses the key to defeat Cubia who starts destroying The World. Haseo requests all the players' help to defeat Cubia's remnants as G.U. and Zelkova locate the main body. Fighting Cubia, Haseo uses all of his Avatar's powers to destroy Cubia and is aided by the mysterious short reappearance of Ovan.\n\nWith Cubia destroyed, all the remaining comatose players awake with Haseo meeting Shino once again. Upon meeting her, Shino motivates Haseo to be more honest with his feelings which causes him to pursue Atoli who believed that Haseo would stay with Shino. A new ending is unlocked by passing the Forest of Pain sidequest in which Haseo is conceded the wish of having another conversation with Ovan; he later states Ovan will return.", 
        "summary": ".hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption is the third entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.",

The same eight characters from the first title return with similar abilities, and the game takes place once again in a zombie-run Raccoon City. The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe.\n\nThe locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.",

Thus begins We Love Katamari, where the King of All Cosmos seeks to help fulfill the wishes of his fans\u2014with the help from his son and his son's cousins, who again travel Earth, rolling things up into a Katamari.\n\nThe King of All Cosmos\u2019s origin:\nThe King of All Cosmos's history is told in We Love Katamari\u2019s cut scenes, interspersed between the game\u2019s stages.\nThe King of All Cosmos was not always the King. His father was the previous King of All Cosmos (also called Emperor of the Cosmos, or Papa). The future King of All Cosmos grew up either on Earth itself or a planet very much like it, in a giant castle on a hill surrounded by green fields. (Though, early in the game, we are to believe all action takes place in a world called \u201cThe Great Cosmos\u201d.)",

Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the castle, placed a curse upon the kingdom and its people, and turned King Trode into a troll and the princess into a horse. A sole surviving castle guard journeys with the king, the princess, a reformed bandit named Yangus and a few other companions in search of the evil jester and a way to break the curse.", 
        "summary": "Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series, developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was also later released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015.\n\nIt is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view.\n\nLike in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.",

It offers fewer features than Wetrix, but it features improved graphics and a new story mode. The aim of the story mode is to travel through four eras and survive attacks from monsters from each one. To survive the attacks simply get enough points to power up the shield. There is also an unlockable world if the player gets enough points. The game also offers a two player vs mode and a single player puzzle mode.\n\nThe title was a launch game for the PlayStation 2 release in Europe.",

        "storyline": "Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.[23]\n\nKratos waged war at the behest of Ares, eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena. Ares had secretly transported Kratos' wife and child to the village; during his frenzied attack on its temple, Kratos accidentally killed them. Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior, the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god. The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin, turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname, \"Ghost of Sparta\". Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed, Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions.", 
        "summary": "Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).",

The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.\n\nIn July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]",

        "summary": "Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s (titled Guitar Hero: Rocks the 80s in Europe) is a music rhythm game and the third installment in the popular Guitar Hero series. It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe, and in August 2007 in Australia.\n\nPlayers use a guitar-shaped controller (purchased separately) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player. Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period.\n\nThe game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.[6]",

A mysterious voice contacts him and says that this world is called Endonesia, and if he wants to return home, he has to call upon its fifty gods. In order to find the gods, the hero has to communicate with the inhabitants of Endnesia by transferring his own emotions to others.\n\nCreated by Taro Kudo and Kazuyuki Kurashima of Love-de-lic fame, Endnesia is one of the spiritual descendants (along with Giftpia and Chulip) of their seminal game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. Like those other games, Endnesia is a puzzle-solving adventure with RPG elements such as statistics, item-gathering, and character growth.\n\nThe theme of the game is sharing emotions; gameplay-wise, it translates into puzzle-solving which involves using the right emotion on the right characters at the right time. For example, using the Hunger emotion on an animal will make it hungry, urging it to find food, which will clear the path for the hero.\n\nSimilarly to Moon and its descendants, Endnesia has a day-night cycle. The hero's health meter is depleted due to exhaustion; though the game's world is quite large, the player always has a time limit for his daily activities. The player should also feed the hero; hunger makes his vision blurry and slows down his pace.",

Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player.\nChuChu Rocket! \u2013 Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score.\nPuyo Pop Fever \u2013 Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen.\nCrazy Taxi \u2013 Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level.\nSuper Monkey Ball \u2013 The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way.\nNiGHTS Into Dreams \u2013 NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way.\nHouse of the Dead \u2013 A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.\nVirtua Striker \u2013 As footballs drop from the top of the screen, the aim is to head them into differently colored and scored balloons on the opposite side of the screen in order to obtain the highest score.\nVirtua Fighter \u2013 Standing to one side, players kick and punch the corresponding attack prompts on the screen in order to defeat the opponent. Block and counter prompts also appear, and must be reacted to accordingly.\nSpace Channel 5 \u2013 Different dance move combination must be remembered when shown by the Morolians, and then repeated in time to the music by hitting six different buttons on the screen.\nBilly Hatcher and the Giant Egg \u2013 By waving their hands over two different targets, players must move Billy and the egg around, and crush enemies and collect fruits along the way to the goal.",

The adventure game is set in an unusual world made of a curious mix between 3D real time graphics and 2D black&white comic style animation.\n\nThe traditional point-and-click genre has been perfectly adapted to the main features of the latest consoles in order to ease the developing of the main plot and minigames. The player is involved in a tricky story full of unexpected twists, intrigue, love and vengeance. In Diabolik\u2019s skin, it won\u2019t take too long to become a skilled thief and a master of disguise to rescue his beloved Eva.\n\nCalled to be the bad guy for once, the player will find himself ensnared in fast-paced combat and stealth sequences. Diabolik is a criminal who likes luxury, expensive cars and robs to enrich himself, following his own morality. Eva, the only woman who can keep up with him, likes being involved in mysterious and complicated stories. Diabolik and Eva make up an unconventional couple; they are lovers and partners in crime.",

        "summary": "Samurai Gojiro Kiryuu comes to the American West in search of his brother. His journey takes him to a corrupt town ruled by a sinister land baron named Goldberg. Though Gojiro isn't interested in righting wrongs, he is soon caught up in the town's problems: killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting Goldberg's machinations. Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro's blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve...\n\nSamurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.",

        "summary": "Namco, the genius company behind Tekken and Ridge Racer, has also proved itself a dab-hand at the motorcycle racing game. Early 2001, the arcade giant released Moto GP for PlayStation 2, and its runaway success quickly led to the research of a sequel. After considerable development time, Namco return with the second instalment.\n\nMoto GP 2 players can expect a glut of updates. New season statistics have naturally been included, and there are now 10 circuits to race on, all of which are genuine true-to-life tracks, bustling with interactivity. The graphics are noticeably better, cleaner, with improved textures and far fewer aliasing troubles.\n\nThe gameplay is as polished as ever, with easy-to-learn controls, a steady learning curve, and AI that doesn\u2019t make you want to tear your hair out... at least until you reach the later stages of the game. Moto GP 2 also offers the usual Championship and Time Trial mode of play. But, in typical Namco fashion, multiplayer mode is where the majority of the fun is to be had. In the entire history of video games, the ability to play the same game with one or more friends is still one of the most welcome features in a game.\n\nMoto GP 2 doesn\u2019t disappoint in this regard. It\u2019s frantic, it gets personal, and that\u2019s what makes it interesting. A grand sequel, all in all. Well worth a look, even if you own the original.",

When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years. During his incarceration, Kiryu is expelled from his organization, the Tojo Clan, and Yumi goes missing. After his release, he learns that ten billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan's private bank, and that the entire Japanese underworld is now searching for the lost wealth.",

A mysterious young girl will lead Kazuma to the answers if he can keep her alive.",

Once arriving in America, all mice immediately discover that there are indeed cats in America. They begin living in a typical late 19th century immigrant manner: working in a sweatshop, living in horrible conditions, being extorted by gangs and living in constant fear of being eaten.",

Animated scenes from the film are used as cut-scenes. It tells the story how Fievel Mousekewitz and his family leave Russia for America. He becomes separated from his family when a storm hits the ship and eventually ends up in New York.",

Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner.\n\nThe game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.",

        "storyline": "The story mode in Budokai 3 takes place on a world map called Dragon Universe. This mode consists of 11 playable characters traveling around Earth or Namek during the four main sagas of Dragon Ball Z: Saiyan Saga, Frieza Saga, Cell Saga, and Majin Buu Saga, while collecting items such as money, capsules, Dragon Balls or unlocking other characters for use in the other game modes. The various characters are each unlocked by completing a required task within Dragon Universe (for example, Dr. Gero is unlocked by defeating Dr. Gero with Yamcha in the Androids Saga).\n\nThe Dragon Universe has a high level of replayability due to events in the game potentially changing from playthrough-to-playthrough. For example, in Goku's first playthrough the majority of the story proceeds as it does according to the anime. However, in the following playthroughs, certain choices can include Goku's fight with Frieza changing into a fight with Cooler instead. These choices can even lead to events such as fighting Broly and Omega Shenron after fighting Super Buu. With eleven characters available for play in Story Mode, and various choices available for each character, Dragon Universe has significantly more replay value than previous Budokai games.", 
        "summary": "The third installment in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai series begins another tournament of champions where only one fighter can prevail. As one of the characters from the Dragon Ball Z animated series, you can master an all-new fighting system that lets you teleport, juggle opponents, fly, and attack in a variety of ways. As you progress through the tournament, you can unlock up to 40 bonus characters from the DBZ universe. You can also post and retrieve character profiles from the Internet.",

        "summary": "Living World Racing is a boat racing game with a cast of eight animals racing in the Living World universe, serving as an advergame.\n\nIt features three game modes (single race, time trial and challenge) and three difficulty levels (beginner, experienced and advanced) to choose from. As with many of the developer's games most of the content is locked from the start : for example only the four first characters can be chosen when you first start a game : Mr Mouse, Mr Hamster, Mr Rat and Mr Guinea Pig. Other characters, boats, tracks and race classes become available after collecting a number of stars.\n\nThe other power-ups are extra lives, power boosts and nutritious items, such as red donuts, green puffs or yellow triangles. Do not forget to \"drive\" over speed stripes to boost your boat, but also collect weapons. These are carrot missiles and pumpkin bombs. But if you use an invincibility shield, no one can use these weapons against you.\n\nFrom the option menu, you can set up sound and music, but also controls and use 8 save slots. As a side feature of the game, the last menu choice gives pet information to kids : chinchillas, mice, Guinea pigs, ferrets, dwarf rabbits, rats, hamsters and rabbits.",

Also included are artwork galleries, instruction manuals and Japanese/overseas variants (bar the English version of Wonder Boy in Monster Land). With the exception of both versions of Wonder Boy in Monster Land and Monster World IV all of the versions of the games included are playable in English or have a separate English release included for the same console (for example, the Game Gear releases and Wonder Boy in Monster World's Mega Drive release).\n\nInterestingly, the Sega Master System version of Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is included in this collection, despite never being released in Japan. The game nevertheless supports the FM Sound Unit add-on, meaning this is the first time the general public could hear this game with its FM soundtrack (without resorting to emulation).",

As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. The Queen destroys part of the bridge; although Yorda tries to save him, Ico falls off the bridge and loses consciousness.\n\nIco awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen. He confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but with her death the castle begins to collapse around him; he is hit by falling debris, breaking his horns, and he falls unconscious. The Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She stirs.",

He appears to be trapped and left for dead. Ayame stuck Rikimaru's sword, \"Izayoi\" (he is seen drawing this sword in the opening CG of Wrath of Heaven) in snow as a monument for her fellow ninja, now considered dead. A year later, Rikimaru reports to Lord Gohda that he has managed to survive this near-death experience; unbeknownst to them, the real Rikimaru is trapped in the 20th century trying to find a way back to their time. \n \nThe game's plot plays differently depending on the character chosen, but connects at certain points. The story revolves mainly around Rikimaru's return and the struggle for the Three Jewels, which are said to give power to those who possess them. These are the Jewels of Heaven, Earth, and Virtue. Tenrai, an evil wizard who wants to get his hands on them, commands a band of his men to take the Jewels from whoever possesses them. However, upon encountering Rikimaru, he seems interested in his power and attempts convincing him to join his men. Rikimaru refuses, and he and Ayame face each one of them. One of the men in Tenrai's arsenal is Onikage, who only serves him to pursue his plan of reviving Mei-Oh (his former master) and Tatsumaru (the former leader of the Azuma Ninja Clan whom Tenrai revived). Rikimaru and Ayame follow Tenrai into his fortress to stop him from destroying the world using the power gained from two of the Jewels. If he can be defeated, peace will be returned to Gohda's land.",

Now your master, Lord Gohda, has called upon you - a cunning stealth assassin - to stop Tenrai and his disciples before all is lost. \n \nLive by honor. Kill by stealth.",

However his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter's request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As he reaches the outskirts of the town, James finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill and his own past.",

The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.",

While Ai Shimizu maintained her role for Kizuna in the game, Miyuki Sawashiro performed the voice for Tamao Suzumi. The game features a \"boy mode\" and a \"girl mode\". Choosing the male version means that the story is told via emails from the player's younger sister; choosing the female version means that the story is told in the player's own diary. The player is given the chance to pair their chosen character with one of the other nine available girls, not including the other possible playable characters. There are twenty-seven different combinations depending on which girl the player chooses at the start of the game.",

        "storyline": "Its plot is independent of and not directly related to the first Valkyrie Profile and takes place hundreds of years before the first game. Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is about two characters, Silmeria and Alicia, who are contained in the same body. Silmeria is one of the valkyries tasked with collecting the souls of brave warriors and delivering them to Valhalla. After she disobeyed Odin, he reincarnated her in the body of Alicia, the princess of Dipan. Silmeria was supposed to remain trapped, but she awakens in the body of the princess, which makes many people think that Alicia is insane or possessed. The king imprisons her and announces her death, but unbeknownst to the public he sends her to live in a small palace outside the city of Crell Monferaigne. In the pre-game prologue, Odin sends the current valkyrie, Hrist, to take Silmeria's soul back to Valhalla. Escaping from Hrist, Alicia/Silmeria flees into the wilderness, where they try to evade capture and attempt to avert a catastrophe that could spark a war between the gods and Midgard.", 
        "summary": "Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria is the second installment of the Valkyrie Profile series.\nTaking place hundreds of years before the original game, the story revolves around two characters living the same body, named Silmeria and Alicia. Together, the two characters work to stop a catastrophe that could cause war between the people and the gods. The game received generally positive reviews, citing its similarity to the original Valkyrie Profile game and its beautiful graphics, but had a convoluted interface and a high degree of difficulty. The game went on to be re-released as a Square Enix \"Ultimate Release\".",

        "summary": "Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2 was the canceled sequel to Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel and was in development by Interplay Entertainment who would self-publish it if it were ever made. The development of the game started before the completion of the original and its development caused the cancellation of Black Isle Studio's Fallout 3. Like Fallout 3, the game was near completion when it was canceled. Like its predecessor, the game would have used the Dark Alliance Engine. It was targeted for a Christmas 2004 release date.\n\nLike other Fallout games, the game would have used a reputation system, only simpler. The game would have featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies. Depending on whether the player is good or evil, the game would have played out differently. Each of the four characters that were playable would have had a different fighting style, therefore each time the player played the game, they would have a different experience. It would have had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends. The Dark Alliance Engine would have been fleshed out and player experience would have been refined. A brand new sneak system would have been added to the game. This system would have allowed players to stealthily follow enemies or use a sniper rifle on them. For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.",

Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. \n \nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.",

The main character is Jade Cornell, a foxy redhead, whose friend Tyler has gotten too close to the truth. The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins. \n \nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter. \n \nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity. \n \nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.",

She was like a big sister to me.\nShe went to the same St Agnes Women's College and learned from lots of interesting books.\nThey were fun days that I never want to forget. After graduating Yukari started working at a certain company.\n\nIn order to chase after her I applied to that same company and got an offer. When I told her her the happy news she replied with a smile.\n\"But I'm probably going to retire soon.\"\n\nSurprised I suddenly said,\n\"But I really thought it would be nice to spend every day working together...\"\n\nSaying those words filled with dissatisfaction was a bit selfish of me, but Yukari just smiled kindly and whispered in my ear.\n\n\"You should know by now too, how wonderful love is... right?\"\nWhen she said that I felt a weird flustered feeling. A love so wonderful that you can just declare it like that, could I feel that way too someday?\n\nBut coming back from my study abroad I was struck by some sudden news.\nYukari killed herself!?\nThere's no way that happened, she was so happy the last time I saw her.\n\nIn order to find the truth of the incident I'm going to work at the same company in the same secretary role that she had from today on.",

The only chance for mankind's survival is a top-secret starship class known as Silpheed and the hyper-skilled pilots at the controls. And so begins the premise of Silpheed: The Lost Planet, a co-development shooting project between Game Arts and Treasure that remakes the early '90s PC shooter of the same name. Features include a large variety of enemy types, multiple weapon upgrades, and polygonal graphics. As an added bonus, Working Designs has removed the slowdown and added analog control for the American version of the game.",

Jason Donovan is the voice of Buzz in the UK and Australia. Different voice-actors are used across Europe for Buzz and Rose.\nPlayers can choose from 16 different contestants to suit that persons personal music taste. These include a pop diva (Gina), a rocker (Phil), a punk, an Elvis (Pelvis) and a disco dude (Stevie). These characters resemble famous pop musicians such as Gwen Stefani, Liam Gallagher and Geri Halliwell and Bob Marley.\nThere are over 1,000 music clips, all of which are international chart-toppers from the 1950s through to 2005 and over 5,000 questions to test a players knowledge, either by playing solo in a fast paced single-player mode or with friends/family in the multi-player game. None of the music clips are original recordings.\nPlayers can also choose to play in short bursts, or over a longer period. All wins and losses can be saved to Memory cards for players to refer to at a later date.",

Only half-understanding what his mother meant, Yukito has been traveling across Japan, vainly searching for this myth-like girl his mother told him about. His latest destination is a small, sleepy town where summer has just arrived; and his encounter with a young girl named Misuzu there sets the wheels of destiny turning....\n\nCLANNAD:\nTomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student at Hikarizaka Private High School, leading a life full of resentment. His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope. This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya\u2019s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa, questioning if she likes the school at all. He finds himself helping her, and as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life heading towards a new direction.\n\nKanon:\nYuuichi Aizawa, a high school student, returns to a town that he last visited 7 years previously to live with his aunt and cousin. For a reason he\u2019s not quite sure of, he can hardly remember anything about his last visit, but initially this doesn\u2019t seem to worry him too much.\n\nThe day after he arrives he goes into town where he (literally) bumps into a girl named Ayu Tsukimiya, and Yuuichi\u2019s memories slowly begin to return.",

        "storyline": "The game begins with Karin Koenig, a lieutenant in the German Army during World War I, traveling to the town of Domremy with a Vatican Inquisitor, Nicolas \"Nicolai\" Conrad, to exorcise a demon there. When they arrive, the demon is revealed to be Yuri from the previous game. Nicolai casts a curse on Yuri; this severely weakens Yuri, but also reveals Nicolas as a member of Sapientes Gladio, a faction of dark sorcerers seeking world domination.\n\nYuri escapes with Karin and they build a small party of allies to thwart Nicolas' plan. Nicolai, a bastard son of Tsar Nicolas II, hopes to take over Russia with the help of Rasputin, the current leader of Sapientes Gladio. Yuri manages to recover his strength with the help of a former Sapientes Gladio sorcerer, Jovis, though his memory is still affected by Nicolai's curse. The group then finds and defeats Rasputin and Nicolai. Before Nicolai can be finished off, however, he is rescued by Kato, a Japanese Envoy and old friend of Yuri's, and taken to Japan.\n\nIn Japan, the party tracks Nicolai to a research lab, where he is possessed by a demon. After learning where he is, the party tracks him, but not before Kato's wife is killed. In despair, Kato attempts to remake the world using his own sorcery, forcing Yuri and his party to put him down\n\nThe game has two possible endings. In the \u201cbad\u201d ending, Yuri's personality and memories are erased by Nicolai's curse, and he spends the rest of his life under the care of Roger Bacon, his old friend. In the \u201cgood\u201d ending, Yuri chooses to die so that he doesn't lose his memories and personality to the curse. He then finds himself at the beginning of the previous game. In both endings, Karin travels back to 1887 and is revealed to be Anne, Yuri's mother.",

        "summary": "Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's \"boost\" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.\n\nEach character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.",

        "storyline": "The game begins in North America in the year 1929 and features two new main characters: a 16-year-old New Yorker named Johnny Garland, and a 21-year-old Native American woman named Shania, who has powers of fusion similar to Yuri and Kurando in the previous Shadow Hearts entries, although she is not a harmonixer. She makes pacts with spirits while Yuri and Kurando turned into demons. The story begins with Johnny, a private detective, being hired by a man named Gilbert to find one Marlow Brown. When Johnny finds the man, however, a mysterious 'window' opens, and from it emerges a monster. The rest of the game follows Johnny, Shania, and company as they attempt to uncover the truth about Gilbert and his plans.\n\nMeanwhile in Brooklyn, a wanted criminal who was severely injured was being pursued by the police. He met a mysterious woman who rescued him by finishing off his pursuers with ease. Then, she healed his wounds with the 'Kiss of Malice.' Nobody knows what her intentions or motives are, nor did she speak a single word. The man who identified himself as 'Killer', called her 'Lady' and thereafter followed her where ever she would go.\n\nShania later teams up with Johnny, accompanied by her guardian, Natan to investigate the strange happening Johnny has witnessed. Arriving at Arkham University, they meet Gilbert, who reveals his true intentions to open the Gate and rain Malice upon the world. Gilbert later teams up with Lady and Killer to achieve his goal. Johnny continues his pursuit to stop Gilbert and meets new allies along the way. They include: Frank; a wacky ninja, Ricardo; a lone guitarist, Master Mao; a cat specialized in the Drunken Fist and Hildegard Valentine; sister of the vampire brothers Joachim and Keith Valentine in the Shadow Hearts series.\n\nTogether, Johnny and his friends travel across the globe to stop the evil plans of Gilbert, Lady and Killer. Johnny finds out a shocking truth along the way - that he was revived using the Emigre Manuscript and that Lady was actually his sister, Grace Garland. Their father had revived them after losing them in an accident. He was eventually killed by Grace as she had transferred all her Will into Johnny in exchange for his Malice. This explains why Lady does not speak; she has no memories and is only acting instinctively on the Malice in her body.\n\nAn epic battle with Killer eventually defeated unlocks Johnny's \"Awaker\" powers and Lady calls out Killer's name for the first time. The ritual to invoke the opening of the Gate of Malice is going underway and Johnny is determined to stop his sister. The team battles Gilbert, powered by Malice, for one last time before the final confrontation with Lady. Lady is finally put to rest with Johnny delivering the final blow and she disappears along with Killer's body.\n\nMonths later, Johnny receives a case from his detective agency and he proceeds to investigate. There are two different endings, the Good Ending and the Bad Ending. In the Good Ending, Shania follows Johnny out of the agency. In the Bad Ending, Shania watches over from a building with red eyes; an evidence that she has been consumed by Malice. The Good Ending can be obtained by maxing out all of Shania's fetishes including the ones for the optional fusion.", 
        "summary": "Shadow Hearts: From the New World is the third official game in the Shadow Hearts series.\n\nThe game series departs from Europe and centers on the \"New World\", the Americas. It is not directly related to the previous games in the series but it occurs in the same universe. The main characters' quest is to investigate mysterious \"windows\" from which vicious monsters pop out.\n\nGameplay follows that of its predecessors, using the Judgment Ring to decide most battle outcomes, as well as many other actions throughout the game. A new \"Stock\" system was made for this game which expands the combination attack system between party members from Shadow Hearts - Covenant and enables double attacks.\n\nThe \"Stock\" system works by filling up a character's stock gauge when he/she performs or receives an attack. A maximum of two stock gauge may be stored. Stock can then be utilized in many ways. For example, doing a Double attack (a character performs two action on the same turn) or starting a Combo consumes one Stock. A Double Combo on the other hand consumes two Stock. The Judgment Ring system essentially remains the same from Shadow Hearts: Covenant, with ring customization and added ring effect items being still available.\n\nMagic returns in the form of Stellar Charts, where characters equip Stellars onto the chart. The charts are based on the constellations of the twelve zodiac signs. Finding and fitting all the Stellars onto the charts rewards the player with the Melt Crest Stellar, the strongest non-elemental magic in the game.\n\nFusion is also back in the game, albeit quite differently. Unlike Yuri, Shania does not possess the power of the Harmonixer where she is able to fuse into different demons. She makes spirit pacts with the different Guardian Spirits and draws on their power to transform. Shania is only able to fuse into four forms but through acquiring fetishes; statues of different animals, she is able to learn different techniques by powering them up.\n\nSnapping photos is more emphasized in this game. Not only can Johnny obtain enemy data through his photographing enemies, he can also trade the snap cards obtained for prizes. Johnny can also draw upon the power of Malice to transform; though this ability comes rather late in the game.",

So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry. \n \nThe game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. \n \nThe game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.",

Set in Japan with hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows gamers to breathe life to a \"lost episode\" as one of three playable characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style, calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible, opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented tactically during combat.",

New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.",

Its action based on the real Master Rallye, the game takes place on a stretch of land that spans Paris to Istanbul, all of which is detailed in full 3D. Priding itself on state-of-the-art vehicle models, MASTER RALLYE is packed with obstacles and hidden bonuses throughout. As would be the case in real life, drivers must parlay quick reflexes and immediate, sharp tactics with a more advanced understanding of strategy, patience, and opponent psychology. Originally released on the PC, the game is the perfect fit for the memory-intensive PlayStation 2 console, and features white-knuckle two-player action.",

The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed.\nAnother new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.",

This artifact, the Treasure Orb, is cursed. After stealing it from a guarded tower, supernatural forces separate Reise\u2019s spirit from his body. His body winds up in a local monastery, alive but comatose. His spirit is helpless-unable to be seen, unable to speak, unable to interact with the world around him aside from being able to pass through light materials such as wood.\n\nThankfully, the head monk of this monastery has enough spiritual power to perceive Reise. He informs the mercenary of his strange position, that he has indeed been cursed for stealing the Treasure Orb. The monk then informs him that the only way for his body and spirit to be reunited is through demonstrations of kindness and courage. And in order to do this, he must possess the bodies of others and carry out tasks which they otherwise might not have the strength to do. These tasks range from helping a child find a cat to saving a lost soldier in a treacherous cavern. Thus, Reise heads into the local fishing village to atone for his transgressions.", 
        "summary": "Tsugunai is the story of Reise, a warrior who has inadvertently angered the Goddess of Light by stealing the mystical Treasure Orb. As punishment, the Goddess of Light forever separates his soul from his body unless he atones for his sins by helping the people of Walondia. Without a physical body of his own, the only way to change the fates of the people is to possess them.",

It is mainly played throughout the state of Victoria but has now gotten a following in other states. \n \nThe game includes all the 16 teams, 692 AFL players with stats and 8 of the stadiums. The game also includes support for the Cameo Eyetoy (PS2 version) that will allow the player to put his/her head into the game on top of one of the players. Full multiplayer gameplay is supported, using Gamespy for online play, or using the Multi-tap you can have up to 4 players. The PS2 version also comes with a bonus \"100 Years of Australian Football\" DVD. \n \nThe later released Xbox and PC versions do not contain the DVD, but because of the later release changes from the AFL draft have been implemented, even though the overall team score has not been updated.",

Up to four players, in single kayaks or controlling a raft together, can play simultaneously to go down rivers, conquer rapids and drop off cliffs. The player especially needs to pay attention to the steering, which is controlled through the analogue sticks, one for each of the character's arms, to avoid a variety of obstacles. This is done by constantly moving them in a circular motion.\n\nNext to the main game modes, there is also a training to explore the course and get used to the handling. The game is endorsed and has been developed in collaboration with Salomon, a manufacturer of articles for outdoor sports.",

Unfortunately, they are intercepted by Dr. M, the owner of the island. Murray and Bentley escape, but a monster grabs Sly. During this scene, Sly's life flashes before his eyes, and the game flashes back.\n\nSly learned that the Cooper Vault was hidden on Kaine Island from one of his father's colleagues, Jim McSweeney. The vault contains the accumulated wealth of the Cooper Clan built up over the centuries. Sly went to find the vault, only to discover that M had built a fortress on the island in an attempt to get at the wealth hidden in the vault. Sly needed additional experts in order to get past Dr. M's extensive security; he needed the Cooper Gang back in action.\n\nFirst, Sly and Bentley seek Murray, who had left the team due to guilt for causing Bentley's leg injury, which would end up paralyzing him. They learn about a mob boss, Octavio, who operates in Venice, Italy, where Murray was. Sly finds Dimitri in a cell at the local police station. He agrees to find Murray if Sly helps him escape. Sly finds Murray, while evading Carmelita Fox, who had become more hateful towards crimes since their last encounter. Murray had become a trainee for a peace-loving figure known as the Guru in order to become more peaceful. Murray refuses to rejoin Sly and Bentley until the canals are clean, the task the Guru gave to him. Sly and Bentley take down Octavio, who had been polluting the canals with tar as part of a scheme to threaten the city into liking opera again. After putting together some plans, they destroy Octavio's comeback recital, but Octavio injures Bentley, making Murray so mad that he quits his training and battles Octavio and defeats him. Octavio is arrested, and Murray rejoins the team.",

The only basis of assessment is if the correct note is hit with the correct timing; the sung words or octave does not play into the result. The PS3 version allows access to the SingStore, an online shop for downloading additional songs.",

Afterwards, Ultraman then crushes the two rocks that Bullton left behind. Later, Ultraman confronts and battles the ancient monster, Gomora. After a quick battle, Gomora tries to escape but Ultraman grabs his tail to stop him, which forces Gomora to detach it before burrowing underground. Red King then appears and attacks Ultraman from behind. Engaging in a violent battle, Ultraman defeats Red King and flies away. Suddenly, a mysterious UFO uses a purple mist on Red King. Meanwhile, Ultraseven battles Eleking at a dam and manages to defeat the monster. Unfortunately, the purple mist appears again and changes Eleking into EX Eleking. Despite the monster's increased power, Ultraseven defeats EX Eleking. The mysterious UFO then flies away. \n \nLater that night, in another city, Ultraman Tiga duels with Kyrieloid. However, Kyrieloid escapes to a cave. There, Ultraman Tiga finds the injured and sleeping Gomora, who awakens and attacks him. After battling him, the monster, still weak from his fight with Ultraman, decides to retreat. Suddenly, Gomora is then killed by Chaos Kyrieloid. Though he had evolved, Ultraman Tiga defeats Chaos Kyrieloid. Ultraman Taro fights the rampaging Tyrant in the city, defeating him after a brutal battle. Taro then quickly heads to a volcano, where he battles with EX Red King. The EX monster is defeated by Taro. Later, Ultraman Cosmos arrives to stop a rampaging Gomora, who has been turned into EX Gomora. However, the military attempted to kill EX Gomora, which Cosmos tries to prevent as he only wants to calm Gomora. Fortunately, Ultraman Cosmos uses his Luna Extract to return him back to Gomora. Gomora then leaves in peace.", 
        "summary": "Ultraman Fighting Evolution Rebirth is the 4th game in the Ultraman Fighting Evolution series. This game was released in the PlayStation 2 console. \n \nIts Story Mode involves Alien Mephilas launching a massive invasion using EX monsters (more powerful versions of the originals) and sending three 'Chaosroids' (dark versions of Ultraman, Ultraseven, and Ultraman Taro) to the Land of Light. Eventually, Mephiles fuses with his final monster, Neo Chaos Darkness. With the combined effort between Cosmos and the other Ultras, they managed to defeat him and stop his invasion.",

        "summary": "Tatacon de Dodon ga Don was the first Taiko no Tatsujin game to be released on the PlayStation 2, the first console to feature Taiko games. All the first-run copies of the game came with a Tatacon, a small plastic drum which is identical in functionality to the bigger arcade drums. As for the future console Taiko titles, the game can also be played with buttons as the alternative control scheme. \n \nDue to the first arcade versions relying on the PS1-grade Namco System 10 board, the game has PS1-grade graphics and longer load times in order to reproduce a good arcade fidelity. For the same reason, the arcade-styled Arcade mode (together with unique ending/Game Over sequences) was ported for the game, together with the (then popular) Battle mode. Arcade mode is also the staple for unlocking secret tracks, for this and the next 3 console games. \n \nThe console-exclusive features added to the first console Taiko game were a Free mode for playing the songs without the song selection constrains of the Arcade mode, the fast-button pressing Don-Chan Race (the first in many Taiko games for Ps2) and the Safari Mode. Free mode also features console-exclusive options, such as custom Taiko sounds selection and an Auto-Play function for every song, which can be toggled on and off by pressing the Select button in the song selection screen. \n \nAbout Safari mode, it plays much like the Donkey Konga games' Survival mode, in which players clear a number of randomly-chosen songs on a set difficulty, starting with the Tamashii gauge full (and not able to recover ticks from errors). The number of songs changes according to the difficulty selected, and the Safari run is won if the Tamashii gauge isn't empty during the play by missing notes.",

As the player hits buttons corresponding to the note placement on the track, the notes activate a small portion of the track. If the player successfully activates enough notes in sequence, the track is \"captured\" and the section will play automatically for a number of bars, freeing the player to capture another section.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe object of the game is to capture a sufficient amount of sections to reach the end of the song. If the player continually misses notes, an energy meter empties until the game is over.",

        "summary": "Mike LeRoi -- the embittered protagonist of the original Shadow Man title, is tasked yet again with saving Liveside and the parallel world of Deadside. In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.\n\nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.\n\nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.",

As a result, the game's depiction of violence is very cartoon-like without losing any of its intensity.

Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion's league, or defending the club's reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well.\n\nThe actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team. The French version portrays manager Guy Roux (famous of Auxerre), while the UK version has Alex Ferguson (Manchester United).",

        "storyline": "Rex Leinster is a young man from the remote, backwater planet Earth, who dreams of one day exploring and adventuring throughout space just like his father. He enters a local space race hoping to earn a bit of money and fame for himself, but winds up losing by a hair. However, his performance attracts the attention of a recruiter for the Lightning Express shipping company, and soon he's hired on as their newest cargo pilot. Unfortunately, Lightning Express is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy, uses outdated and poorly-maintained equipment, and is generally a laughingstock across the galaxy. But everyone's got to start somewhere, right?", 
        "summary": "Rim Runners is a light-hearted, anime-style sci-fi visual novel. The player takes the role of rookie cargo pilot Rex as he tries to make a name for himself with the crew of his ship, the Jack Pot. Like most visual novels, the game progresses linearly, with occasional dialogue choices affecting the flow of the story. At certain points, the player can explore the ship and speak with its crew and passengers freely. There are also so-called \"Live Command\" sequences when situations get heated or particularly dangerous; during these events, choices have a strict time limit, it is not possible to save or reload the game, and incorrect choices can easily lead to losing a job or even a game over.",

The two have been traveling for a long time on this offbeat path, through murky forests and wet grasslands alike.\n\nThey arrive at last at their destination: a tall stone gate with a narrow passage. On the other side lies an enormous bridge of near-otherworldly construction. The bridge spans over the Forbidden Lands, a dramatic landscape of plains and canyons with enclosed and cut-off environments ranging from arid deserts to clefts with tall geysers to dark forests and murky crevasses.\n\nThe bridge finally comes to an end at the Shrine of Worship, a gigantic structure in the middle of the Lands. Wander and Agro make their way to the ground floor and the temple's main hall, which is lined with sixteen stone idols. At the end of the empty hall is an altar. Here it is shown that Wander is carrying something with him: a body wrapped in a cloth sheet. He places the body on the altar and removes the sheet, revealing Mono, a young woman clothed in a white dress.\n\nThe game suddenly cuts to a picture of an owl mask amidst a cloudy sky. From here, Lord Emon, a spiritual leader in Wander's society, speaks an esoteric monologue:\n\nThat place...began from the resonance of intersecting points...\nThey are memories replaced by ens and naught and etched into stone.\nBlood, young sprouts, sky - and the one with the ability to control beings created from light...\nIn that world, it is said that if one should wish it, one can bring back the souls of the dead.\nBut to trespass upon that land is strictly forbidden...\n\nAgro is suddenly frightened by a noise from behind the trio. Several shadowy apparitions are emerging from the temple floor, and Wander sees this and draws a mysterious sword from its sheath, pointing it towards the shadows. The blade emits an otherworldly energy, and the creatures immediately dissolve into thin air. Immediately, a booming pair of voices fill the halls from a great aperture above, surprised that Wander possesses the \"Ancient Sword\". Wander correctly identifies the voices as belonging to Dormin and asks that Mono be revived. Initially, Dormin expresses an indifference towards the matter, but ultimately cannot hide the interest in the sword Wander carries.",

Some of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses. \n \nAll of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which \"pod\" sidekick to choose. \n \nThere are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges. \n \nThe Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.",

Can he stop the culprit from taking full revenge?\u201d\n\nThis is an adventure game based on a classical mystery novel. Running out of petrol and lost in the mountains on a stormy night, Ichiyanagi Nagomu, a university student has no choice but to leave his car and ask for help from the nearest mansion within the woods. However, a shock is waiting for him in that dark night. He finds the corpse of a middle age man lying in the rain at the backyard of the mansion. Without any time to recover from his shock, somebody sneaks up behind him and attacks him.\n\nWhen he wakes up, he is in the company of a troop of actors and actresses there to train for new play written by the famous play-writer Boushiya, and being mistaken as the ninth actor, nobody believed what Nagomu saw at the backyard. Because of the injuries he has suffered earlier and the storm still raging outside, there is no alternative for him but stay in the mansion.\n\nLater that night, the troop and Nagomu discovers a message that reads \"Revenge\" in the green house. Afterwards the troop realized that the tires of their cars have all been punctured and there is no escape route. Fear permeates the air that night, but that is only the beginning of their ordeals. The next day, one of the actors is found dead with his corpse arranged in a peculiar way.\n\nPanic erupts when a landslide cuts the mansion off from the rest of the world and being overpowered by fear, the only thing the actors and actresses think of is to protect themselves. This leaves the case solely upon Nagomu's shoulders since he is the only one unrelated to the act of \"revenge\".",

Taking the situation seriously, the Ministry of State Happiness urgently summoned a scientist as a \"koufuku sousakan (happiness manipulator)\" with the authority to manage Clover.", 
        "summary": "Set in a modern town created in a virtual space in Japan in the near future, this is a simulation game that aims to liberate 100 people who have become immobile and to give happiness to all. The player acts as an officer in charge of managing the virtual space, and aims to normalize the people he or she contacts while observing the life of any \"avatar\" living there, to protect the avatar from frequent attacks by obstructionists, and to collect and redistribute the feelings of happiness and unhappiness that they emit, in order to achieve a certain level of happiness for all people. Avatar behavior changes in response to happiness and can be influenced by other avatars involved in life. That is, even with the same avatar, life can change depending on the degree of happiness of the other avatars that are actively acting or negatively distressed by the sense of well-being during observation, or are involved with or in contact with other avatars that were previously offline. The interaction between people is called \"human scramble\" on the package and official website. Each avatar lasts about 20 minutes, and you can watch the same avatar over and over again.\n\nThe whole story is represented by 3DCG, but the avatar is represented by flat shading (a projection method that looks like an angular figure with fine planes). Avatar conversations and thoughts are expressed as text, and their voices are expressed as indistinct voices.",

It is your task to retrieve the seven stones and to restore peace in the land.\n\nIn this strategy RPG, the emphasis is on preparation for the battles rather than on the battles themselves. Before each battle, you are able to see the stats of the monsters and even the tactics they are going to use. You must then select seven units of various classes (knights, archers, mages, etc.) and place them on a battle field, which is a grid composed of four columns and three rows. Front row can attack, middle row support or attack with bows, and back row heals. The battle itself is controlled by computer AI, but you can change formation at any time.",

One day, she is visited by a gentleman named Nyx and learns that she has the dormant power to purify Thanatos, or incorporeal monsters that prey on the everyman. She leaves her school life to join Nyx's Thanatos exterminating business: \"Aube Hunters\". She soon realizes that she is the only female with purification powers because she is the oft fabled Queen Egg, or a legendary savior. Her goal is to work with her fellow Aube Hunters to eradicate Thanatos and restore the land's peace.", 
        "summary": "Neo Angelique is the fourth Neoromance entry and an alternate universe of the Angelique series. Character designs and illustrations were done by Kairi Yura. Maki Fujioka was the character designer for the characters' animated counterparts, both in the game and for the TV series. Character image songs were composed by Yujiro Okazaki.\n\nRuby Party originally devised the game to be a minor side story for the main Angelique series. During the brainstorming sessions for the plot and characters, the members realized that their project's ambitions far surpassed their starting expectations. Therefore, they shifted gears to make an \"Angelique title friendly to newcomers\", seeking to capture the series's charm without requiring the player to have extensive knowledge of prior lore. Role-playing game elements were devised to take center stage in gameplay due to its popularity in fan surveys at the time. The keywords for this title's narrative are \"beautiful, noble, and romantic\".\n\nThe Premium Box included eight postcards, a character message CD and fully colored comic book/manual. Consumers who reserved the game or Full Voice through Gamecity Shopping received a mouse pad with their purchase.",

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's \"boost\" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.",

Why don't we go investigate?\"\nIn that kind of noncommittal fashion they went to look into it.\n\nAt the shrine Hamura and Kuga were waiting.\nThey weren't really on good terms with those two, they were more like complete strangers.\nWith a quick greeting the investigation started.\n\nThe shrine was pretty old and even though it wasn't locked the door wouldn't open.\nIt seemed like it was rusted shut, when they tried to pry the doors open they quickly crumbled.\nWithin that dirty rubble they saw \"something\".\nAs they blankly gazed at that \"something\" suddenly smoke started pouring out.\n\n\"What if it's poison gas!!\"\n\nWith all their might they threw the \"something\" as far away as they could.\nBut after all that they were still enveloped in the smoke coming from that \"something\".

Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.",

She and her aide, Rachel, work with their established Royal Institute to keep their region harmonious.\n\nThree years after the events of Angelique Tenku no Requiem, a large continent suddenly collides with the lone planet and the Queen disappears into a mysterious mist. Rachel implores the Sacred Bird Cosmos for their help, yet they too fall victim to the mist. As the friends reunite, they stand before a mysterious silver tree on the foreign continent known as Arcadia. The protagonist alone hears a voice pleading for her to \"release the seal\", soon discovering that the brittle continent is on the verge of collapse within its pocket dimension. The Queen of the Sacred Bird Cosmos uses her powers to create a barrier to stall the destruction to occur in 115 days. The protagonist has to cultivate the continent within that time to save its trapped inhabitants and release the mysterious seal.",

With his four companions, Serf, the main character and a member of a tribe called Embryon, sets out for Nirvana, a land that can only be reached by the champions of Junkyard. They devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod, suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party's demonic transformation. They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. \"They who reach Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard.\" The struggle intensifies, and they discover that the girl holds a key to the mystery. But, true fear still awaits Serf's party. Including Embryon, the tribe that the main character leads, several groups are at war with each other in order to survive. \"Devour\" your enemies and absorb their devastating powers and special abilities!",

In a series of battles, from battle royales to one-on-one duels, you must entertain the crowds by spilling blood.\n\nAfter battles, it's time to train. A series of minigames improves your attributes and your diet perfects your body.

Decade Mode differs from standard gameplay in that Decade's Form Change and Special Attacks are customizable with KamenRide Cards and Final FormRide Cards earned as the player progresses. The missions in the mode are divided by three levels, with the easiest missions can be played in Level 1 while the hardest can be found in Level 3. Level 2 and 3 can be unlocked as the player progress in Level 1.", 
        "summary": "Kamen Rider: Climax Heroes is a 3D crossover fighting game featuring the heroes of 10 different Kamen Rider TV series, from Kuuga through to Decade. The story is set in the Decade universe, where the worlds of the other nine Riders are all combining into one, and they must work together to save their worlds before they are completely destroyed.\n\nThe game plays much like other 3D fighters such as Tekken, with the major addition being the so-called \"Form Change\" system that allows each Rider to transform during battle, and even in the middle of a combo. The main story mode is \"Decade Mode\", where the player must complete various missions with different characters to proceed through the story. There are also standard Versus, Survival, and Training modes. The game also includes a simple control option for younger players.",

The Shumal Kingdom's outlying principalities are in a state where they can't sustain themselves without help. With conflicts over the succession of princes and wars between different ethnic groups going on all the time the people are exhausted.\nBut Lumina knows nothing of that reality, she is growing up sheltered in her own little pure world.\n\nOne day it is decided that Lumina will be engaged to a influential prince, the ruler of \"Ibleland\" Laios.\nLumina opposed the one-sided decision of her father and snuck out of the palace. There she learned that the world is completely different than the one she had been taught about up till now and she was shocked.\n\n\"I want to know the real world. I don't want to be a person who doesn't know anything about important people.\"\n\nFacing the opposition of her father, Lumina goes on a journey to explore the world.\nWith the company of her childhood friend Ashe who is the kingdom's best swordsman, and her young genius boy tutor Pelmo, Lumina's adventure begins.",

The occupants of this warehouse include a kindly looking old doctor, and a man with a notable scar on his face. Mika arrives, and the man with the scar claims the contents of the case: two massive handguns. That man is revealed to be the game's title character Grave, and now that he is armed he can start his mission.\n\nGungrave first approaches its stages as a series of missions issued by Dr. T, first to gather information on the current makeup of Millennion from a low-level street gang, and next destroying a research facility that creates Harry's undead soldiers. In the third stage, while attempting to pump information from an informant, Grave comes into contact with the leadership of the Millenion organization\u2014once friends and allies that he now faces as enemies. Each have used the research Harry supported to give themselves inhuman powers. From here on, Grave is hounded by each member as he makes his way to Harry's tower at the heart of the city.",

The player first commands only one knight, with several others fighting on his side. During the course of the game, the player will control up to four parties of warriors simultaneously. The RTS element with sending troops to battle enemies or protect important locations co-exists with rather simple \"hack-and-slash\" combat mechanics that apply to the characters which are controlled directly by the player.",

Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.",

        "storyline": "The Game has 4 campaigns: War in the Pacific, Winter Offensive, Victory in Europe, and Victory in the Pacific. The player takes on the role of a marine in the Pacific campaigns and both British and American soldiers in the European campaign. Unlike the PC \"World at War\" titles, Final Fronts has a training level. The War in the Pacific and Victory in the Pacific Campaigns see Private Joe Miller (a reference to World at War protagonist C. Miller) and his fellow soldiers Sgt. Roebuck and Pvt. Polonsky (also in World at War) fight their way through Japanese defenses on Guadalcanal, Betio, Saipan, and Okinawa. A major difference in the American campaign from World at War is the fact that both Roebuck and Polonsky survive the final battle for Okinawa (also, Sgt. Roebuck shares a similar character model to Sgt. Dixon from Call of Duty 3). The Winter Offensive and Victory in the Europe campaigns have three protagonists: Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the US 80th Infantry Division of George S. Patton's Third Army, Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airborne Division, and Gunnery Sergeant Alex McCall of the US 4th Armored Division. The Winter Offensive campaign sees the Americans and British move to relieve the city of Bastogne (while the 80th take Ettelbruck in Luxembourg), and the Victory in Europe campaign sees the British 6th Airborne Division capture the town of Weser during Operation Varsity and the Americans capture Adolf Hitler's birthplace of Braunau-am-Inn in Austria.", 
        "summary": "Call of Duty: World at war - Final Fronts is a first-person shooter game. It focuses is on single-player campaigns, as it has no multiplayer. The game is set in World War II. The player can carry two guns at one time, as well as grenades. Levels are played with a team of soldiers from both Britain and the U.S, that assist the player by killing enemies and completing objectives. The game has been criticised by some critics for the poor AI, which is evident when friendly soldiers push you out of cover and into the enemy line-of-fire.",

A two-player split screen mode is included in the game, as well as the Time Trial and Cup racing modes for one player. The player should choose a craft they like to use in the game, and then go through five series (each including six tracks). After the race has loaded, the screen will show a view of the track. The player will see a countdown that would begin the race. The player must finish at first, second or third place to win. If he or she successfully completed a series, the player unlocks more material. Despite the tracks incorporating twists, turns, loops, corkscrews and jumps, various obstacles are considered avoidable for him or her. Falling off the track is one example. When below the third position, he or she will lose. In addition, there are the boost and health icons throughout each track.",

The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck.\n\nIn a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.",

Set in the year 3010, this game envisions a world where evil governments are desperate for something good to put on TV to entertain their teeming masses. The solution - a race. In this race the runner races around an obstacle strewn track chased by a machine that is a cross between a tank and a steam roller. Stay ahead and you win, get caught and you're history.  \n \nThe player's point of view is always above and in front of the runner, looking back at them as they run towards the camera. The track is littered with objects which the runner must either avoid, jump over, or duck under. These obstacles can just pop up out of the track as the runner approaches so quick reactions are needed. \n \nThere are three game modes:  \n \nStandard Mode: here there is the Single sprint mode where the player can practice any unlocked circuit. Then there's the Multiple Sprint mode which is locked until Tournament Mode has been completed, completing the Multiple Sprint mode unlocks 16th stadium.  \n \nTournament Mode: here there are five leagues, completing a league will unlock further stadiums and hence give access to the next league. Completing the final league unlocks stadium fifteen and the Multiple Sprints mode  \n \nExploration Mode: Here the player has to complete series of races that unlock new characters.",

Immerse yourself in this technically challenging game and see if you have what it takes to be the champion of the second World Fighting Tournament!\n\nOn paper, the PlayStation 2 version of Virtua Fighter II mirrors its arcade counterpart exactly. The people who worked on this port were clearly aiming for an arcade perfect title. The game apparently reads the controller at the same frequency as the arcade, 57.5 times per second. Purists who demand perfect timing for their combos should be in heaven. The resolution of the arcade has also been replicated, with VF2 running on the PS2 in 496x384 resolution. This leaves black bars around the game, but you can select to zoom up to full screen in the options menu of you want. The game offers up arcade, versus and ranking modes of play, all playable using either version 2.0 or 2.1 settings (selectable in the options menu).",

This place bears a strong resemblance to Kyoto at the end of the Heian period, where the Minamoto clan (Genji), led by Minamoto no Yoritomo (based on the historical Minamoto no Yoritomo), is at war with the Taira clan (Heike), led by Taira no Kiyomori (based on the historical Taira no Kiyomori). The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the Earth's natural flow of energies and to terrorize the land. The boy that Nozomi met is revealed to be the human form of Hakury\u016b, the White Dragon God said to protect Ky\u014d, whose powers have greatly weakened due to the presence of the onry\u014d. Nozomi discovers that she has the power to seal the onry\u014d as Hakury\u016b no Miko, and she allies herself with the Genji in order to seal the onry\u014d, restore Hakury\u016b's powers, and return home to her own world.",

        "summary": "Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.\n\nThe game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.",

Duvall. A US government agent named Bruce McGivern is sent to stop Morpheus from spreading the zombie T-virus any further.", 
        "summary": "Resident Evil: Dead Aim is a survival-horror game released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 under the Gun Survivor title, which was used for several games made for the Namco light gun controllers. The game is played in two camera angles: the player moves from a third-person perspective while walking, which changes to a first-person perspective while aiming the gun. You'll pick up several guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle. But like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently and ammo can be very scarce.",

At the same time, an extremist named Colonel Volgin fires an American-made portable nuclear missile at the Soviet design bureau OKB-754, sparking an international incident. In order for America to clear its name and avoid World War III, a man named John and codenamed Naked Snake is dispatched by the special forces unit FOX to assassinate the woman who taught him everything.", 
        "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the prequel to the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over and as before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.",

        "storyline": ".hack//G.U. takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the year 2017. As depicted in the first .hack game series, the \"2nd Network Crisis\" was an incident that occurred seven years ago in which many computer systems across Japan malfunctioned. Through the efforts of those games' hero, Kite, the incident resulted in the birth of Aura, the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making decisions for itself. Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period.\n\nIn late 2014, Aura disappears, resulting in the slow decay of The World and the Internet as a whole. In response, the company that administrates The World, CC Corp, sets up \"Project G.U.\" and tasks them with remedying the problem. They come up with the \"Restore Aura (RA) Plan\", in which they attempt to retrieve the fragments of Morganna\u2014an AI that served as Aura's \"mother\"\u2014and seal them into player characters (PCs) of The World. In theory, this would allow the Project G.U. programmers to manipulate the Morganna program to recreate Aura. Only certain \"chosen\" players could control these special \"Epitaph PCs\".\n\nAfter locating candidates to operate the Epitaph PCs, the team proceeds to test the RA Plan despite concerns over \"anti-existences\" that might damage the Internet. The program fails catastrophically and destroys over 80% of the data for The World.[9] Instead of trying to salvage the data, CC Corp develops The World R:2 and releases it to a new generation of players. However, this new game is less popular than its predecessor and becomes plagued by \"player killers\" (PKs), players who target other players for fun and sport. The Epitaph PCs which had been lost during the RA Plan disaster resurface in the new version, attached to certain players of interest.\n\nVol 1: Rebirth:\nThe story starts with Haseo who, eight months after starting playing in The World, has become a powerful player killer killer or PKK and searches for Tri-Edge, responsible for killing his friend Shino's character and leaving the player behind her in a coma. Tri-Edge uses an illegal skill on Haseo, which resets his character data to level one. Lacking the strength he once had, Haseo is mistaken for a newbie player by Silabus and Gaspard, who invite him to join their guild, Canard, eventually becoming its Guild Master. During this, he is approached by Kuhn and Pi, two players associated with G.U., a group run by Yata who works for CC Corp, and is investigating AIDA, a bizarre computer anomaly that is appearing in the game. Yata requests Haseo's help as he is an Epitaph User, and is one of the eight players who can use an Avatar, the only vehicle to combat AIDA. Haseo agrees on the condition that Yata find Tri-Edge for him, which Yata agrees with.\n\nDuring this time he is repeatedly contacted by Atoli, a gentle healer that tries to convince Haseo to enjoy the game and its world more, though Haseo is annoyed by her resemblance to Shino. Haseo also watches an arena match between Endrance, Arena Emperor, and a challenger, and is startled to see Endrance, a player he saw with AIDA, use an Avatar. Determined to learn more, he joins the arena and eventually defeats Endrance. After winning, Atoli, on advice from Ovan, finds a Tri-Edge sign, a red carving, and transports to a region outside the normal game parameters, determined to get Haseo to see her as valuable. Realizing she is in great danger, Haseo, Pi, and Kuhn locate her struggling to open a locker. After distracting her, Tri-Edge appears, and is defeated by Haseo. After doing so, an AIDA attacks Atoli's character.", 
        "summary": ".hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game; players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.",

Styled similar to cinematography found in The Wachowskis' The Matrix film franchise and gameplay mechanics in games such as Dead to Rights and Max Payne, the player is given an ability to slow down time and thus dodge multitudes of flying bullets and other obstacles. The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities. Between the action sequences, the player must advance the plot through a graphic adventure-style interface, where certain characters must be spoken to in order to continue.",

Riho is putting on a special concerts for the 5th anniversary of her debut, and her manager has asked her to do dance aerobics training to perfect her rhythm.\n\nDuring each song, a cursor scrolls across a set of four bars with notes arranged on them in time with the music. The player must move the cursor to as many notes as possible, and press the button on the controller in time with the music to dance along. Play well, and Riho will stay with the rhythm and earn points, but play poorly and she will start to get out of breath. If too many wrong notes are played, the song will be failed and end early.\n\nExtra songs and costumes can be unlocked by beating preset scores in the Lesson mode. There are a total of 12 songs and 14 costumes to unlock. It is also possible to save replays of performances to watch later without the note bar obscuring the view of Riho.",

Use swords, guns, and even barriers made of rice to weaken the Kyonshis, then stab them with your lucky charm. The people you're trying to protect all have unique traits, some being slow, others being weak, and you'll have to study their data in order to properly guide them to safety. You can send commands to the people you're guiding, telling them when to stop and when to play dead (this latter act makes the Kyonshis stop their attack).",

After a quick intervention with Balmung, the two return to Dun Loireag, where Kite is told that his Book of Law he won from the Level Up Campaign has an error that prevents it from being installed, so it is replaced with the Book of Absolute (which also cannot be installed). BlackRose claims to have never heard of the event.\n\nThe two receive e-mails telling them to come to \u0398 Soaring Sky Bounded Abyss if they want to know more about the coma victims. It is actually a trap set up by system administrator Lios. Lios says that they should not pursue the matter any further and proceeds to delete Kite's character data along with the bracelet. Helba, however, interferes, saying that they cannot be deleted because of a mysterious encryption implanted in their character data. She introduces the theory that The World is based on the Epitaph of Twilight, telling the two to look to the Epitaph for clues. She then suggests to Lios to observe the two rather than try to delete them. Lios eventually agrees, deciding to use the two and the unique abilities of the bracelet to investigate the corrupted areas.", 
        "summary": ".Hack//Mutation is the second of a series of four games, titled .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and .hack//Quarantine, features a \"game within a game\"; a fictional massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called The World which does not require the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and data between games in the series. Each game comes with an extra DVD containing an episode of .hack//Liminality, the accompanying original video animation series which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.\n\nThe games are part of a multimedia franchise called Project .hack which explores the mysterious origins of The World. Set after the events of the anime series .hack//Sign, the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some users have become comatose as a result of playing The World. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of The World and its effects on the stability of the Internet.",

The 100 top scorers will be recognized through an interactive ranking system, letting novice players test their dancing mettle against top-notch DDR experts. Players can also go online to access new challenge missions which will be refreshed periodically, allowing players a way to continually expand the DDR gaming experience. Whether players are looking to dance to the hottest tracks in town, choreograph, edit and create their own dance steps, or use the 'Work Out' mode to burn off excess pounds, DDR Extreme 2 will offer players of all ages an interactive and fun way to get up and groove. The game's support for the EyeToy Camera continues to add depth and dimension to the gameplay. While using the camera, players can access fast-paced mini games and use both their hands and feet while dancing and watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music, including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as \"Genie In A Bottle\" and \"Oops!...I Did It Again.\" Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.",

The title is a spiritual successor to Gunparade March containing the same style of hybrid gameplay where the player interacts with AI controlled NPCs and then participates in combat segments with them. Sony's Prokion and Alfa System developed Kenran Butou Sai with the title being a part of the studio's larger interconnected universe known as Unkown World.\n\nA television anime based off the world of Kenran Butou Sai, but focusing on a different story and characters, aired a year before the game's launch in 2004 called Mars Daybreak. The show was produced by Bones and was later released in North America by Bandai Entertainment in 2006.",

Helba's server has all the same functions, except the server looks like Net Slum. Now that they are relatively safe, Helba says that the Wave is still moving and that she will work on a vaccine to defeat it. Lios then orders Kite to measure data fluctuations by going to \u03a9 Bigoted Snowflake's Capsule.\n\nShortly after getting the data for Lios, it is reported that the Nizato University Hospital, the place Yasuhiko is being hospitalized in, suffered a blackout. Kite does not have much time left. Luckily, he gets another clue from Net Slum resident Spiritas, who tells him of Harald having something to do with \u03a3 Screaming Wind Sand's Fate Castle.

In desperate need of a hero, Illusia calls upon one of its own to save the land from a dire threat. Players will guide this young warrior on an epic quest that will have them adventuring across a completely 3D world for the first time in the series. From majestic plains to towering mountains, the interactive environments in Dawn of Mana offer an assortment of places to visit, characters to meet, and creatures to battle. The combat system once again unfolds in real-time, with players able to jump, slash with a sword, fire projectiles, and even swing a whip that can attach itself to objects.",

This MS team was created by Kycilia Zabi and participated in the capture of the California Base during the 2nd Earth Invasion Plan. \n \nLt. Garret Schmitzer was a mobile suit veteran during the first stage of the One Year War, the One Week Battle back in January. At the end of the One Week Battle, Lt. Schmitzer was badly wounded, and forced into retirement. This was due to Operation British, the operation that would force a space colony, into the Earth's orbit for a collision course to South America, where the Federation's top forces were, Jaburo base. \n \nThe injuries were extensive, but hope was on the horizon. Kycillia Zabi formed an elite mobile suit unit onto the front lines, the Fenrir Corps. Since Lt. Schmitzer was fluent in battle experience, he was the lead commander and mission director of the Fenrir Corps, better known as the Midnight Fenrir. \n \nYou take command of Midnight Fenrir Corps in the game. Eventually, by completing missions, more pilots will join in the Fenrir Corps' long and hard fought struggle. \n \nIt is the first Gundam based PlayStation 2 game that lets the player operate solely as Zeon forces",

Since the revelations of the true causes behind the 2nd Huffman Conflict in 2092, the world grew wary of the Republic of Zaftra. Zaftra began losing foreign investments and many businesses withdrew from the union, resulting in major economic losses. Superpowers such as the United States of the New Continent (USN) refused offers from the union to import their natural resources, the major economic driver of their economy. With a failing economy and growing distrust from the world community, the Republic of Zaftra disbanded the Peace Mediation Organization (PMO) in 2094. Meanwhile, the discovery of natural resources in Poland led the European Community (EC) to stop importing raw materials from Zaftra. Consequently, Zaftran citizens began migrating to other countries in search for work. In 2096, the Republic of Zaftra returned to the spotlight after a mysterious blitzkrieg of EC military bases leaves Europe in an imminent resource crisis. Elsewhere in the world, Venezuela suddenly declares independence from the USN.", 
        "summary": "In the year 2096, the Wanzer (\"Walking Tanks\" mecha) form the backbone of many military forces. The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as \"Durandal\". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity... \n \nFront Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.",

        "summary": "Kuon is a horror game set in Heian period (12th century) in Japan. You control three protagonists in the game. The story revolves around a man named Doman, an exorcist who was summoned by one of the noblemen to investigate a cursed manor. His daughter Utsuki is out to search for him when he doesn't return, and her sister is charmed by demons inhabiting a mysterious castle, turning into a demon herself. A young girl named Sakuya, Doman's disciple, also ventures into the depths of the demonic world, to prove herself worthy of her master. Once the player completes Utsuki's and Sakuya's scenarios, he unlocks the third scenario where he experiences the story from the point of view of Doman himself.\n\nThe game is a mixture of third-person action and puzzle-solving. As in all survival horror games, your means of defense are limited and scarce. Unlike most games of the kind, physical attacks with weapons are not your only way to defend yourself against hordes of undead creatures. You can also learn and cast spells in the game, and even summon creatures (wolves, spiders, etc.) to fight at your side.",

Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.\n\nThe game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.",

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. \n \nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.",

Using a spectral analysis system, the game will generate a step routine for each song that is average length. Dance Factory comes with five licensed tracks ranging from Tim MacGraw's \"I Like It, I Love It\" to the Pussycat Dolls tribute to home wreckers in \"Don't Cha.\" The game comes with three dance difficulties such as easy, normal, and pro flavors, and the object is to hit the arrows on the dance mat at the correct time. As you hit the arrows, you will be informed if your step was bad timing, pretty good, or perfect. Increasing your accuracy unlocks bonus combos, and by filling the rank meter you can increase your score and change the animated visuals in the background. \n \nDance Factory includes five modes of play to entertain and exercise your body and brain. \"Normal\" mode has you dancing through one song while endurance mode challenges you to dance through an entire album. \"Fitness\" mode does not keep score, but counts calories that are lost as you boogie to the beat. \"Record\" mode allows you to save your custom dance routines for later use, and \"EyeToy Camera\" mode lets you see your movements and also adds two extra steps that you execute by using your hands. \"Creature\" mode will access bebop beasts that are hiding in music CDs everywhere. The creatures dance in the background as you cut a rug, and credits earned can be used to accessorize your new friend with sunglasses, jewelry, portable radios, and more. Challenge your friends to a den dance-off with a multiplayer option for up to 16 jivers.",

This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises. \n \nPresented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.",

Here, you really can go from the very bottom to the very top, and it adds a challenging long term goal to the proceedings. It's just one example of where the game differs from the opposition, and there are plenty more. For instance, you can also try and blatantly blag a penalty by diving in the area. You can get penalised for handball. You can even take it online and test your skills. In short, there's plenty going on.",

        "summary": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero is a racing game developed by Genki for PlayStation 2. Despite its name, it is set between Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 and Drift, and has enhanced sound and graphics. The game was released in Japan as Shutokou Battle 0, but was also a release in North America. The game was released in a PAL version in Europe and Australia under the title Tokyo Xtreme Racer (not to be confused with the Dreamcast title of the same name).\n\nThis is the first game in the series that has been released on a platform other than the Dreamcast. Zero was originally to be released on the Dreamcast but was then canceled and moved to the PlayStation 2. The Tokyo Xtreme Racer series has produced a total of six games, the first four being U.S. localizations of the first four Shutokou Battle series games and the final two being U.S. localizations of the first and third Kaido Battle series games.",

It's a part of the Simple 2000 series by Japanese publisher D3 Publisher, as part of a series of budget priced games that usually sell at 2000\u00a5.\n\nYou play as Aya, a scantily clad cowgirl with a scarf, in a hack-and-slash against slow-moving zombies in little arena's. There is a feature called \"sword fatigue\": if you don't clean your sword in time, it will get stuck in an enemy, giving him an advantage over you. There are also slight RPG elements. You can upgrade your characters by collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies. At the end of each level, you can use the orbs to make Aya more powerful. Sometimes the enemies drop red orbs; if you collect enough of them, you turn into a demon. Your attacks become more powerful, but they also take away from your health.",

As the first shooter game in the Final Fantasy series, the action is viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective similar to Resident Evil 4, although players can switch to a first-person perspective if they wish. Defeating enemies yields EXP, and at the end of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.",

Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed.\n\nThere are five varied game play modes: Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other",

        "summary": "Dino Stalker is a horror light gun shooter video game developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2. It is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.",

On his 8th birthday, Sly was supposed to inherit the book and learn all of his family's ancient secrets which was supposed to help him become a master thief, however, a group of thugs by the name \"The Fiendish Five\" (led by Clockwerk, who is the arch-nemesis of the family clan) attack the Cooper household and kills Sly's parents and stole all of the pages from the Thievius Raccoonus. After that, the ruthless gang go their separate ways to commit dastardly crimes around the world. Sly is sent to an orphanage where he meets and teams up and forms a gang with two guys who become his lifelong best friends, Bentley, a technician, inventor and a talented mathematical hacker with encyclopedic knowledge who plays the role as the brains of the gang, and Murray, a huge husky cowardly guy with a ginormous appetite who plays the role as the brawns and the getaway driver of the gang. The three leave the orphanage together at age 16 to start their lives becoming international vigilante criminals together, naming themselves \"The Cooper Gang\". Sly swears one day to avenge his family and track down the Fiendish Five and steal back the Thievius Raccoonus. 2 years later, the Cooper Gang head to Paris, France, to infiltrate Itnerpol (a police headquarters) in order to find the secret police file which stores details and information about the Fiendish Five but during the heist they are ambushed by Inspector Carmelita Fox (towards whom Sly develops a romantic attraction), a police officer who is affiliated with Interpol and is after the Cooper Gang. The gang manage to steal the police file and successfully escapes from her and the rest of the cops. With the secret police file finally in their hands, the Cooper Gang manage to track down the Fiendish Five.",

The construction is hidden deep in the valley and the only way to enter is through a rope bridge. Nagomu learned of the history of the castle during dinner with the current owner of the castle.\n\nThe ancestor of the young nobleman has been studying black magic and satanic rites. He has been trying to summon a demon by offering youths as sacrifices. After numerous failed attempts, he finally managed to call upon a demon to possess his sacrifice. The castle is then built in the valley to keep the possessed youth from escaping. The youth's mother has entered the castle to find her son, but she too disappeared not long afterwards.\n\nAccording to the rumors, the ghost of the mother is still in search of her son and the youth is still somewhere within the castle.\n\nDuring the conversation, the castle is blacked out, and in the darkness the occupants can feel the evil in the air.",

Those who can defeat \"Nine Ball\" (which likely means you if you see the end credits of Nine Breaker) are labeled as the true most powerful mech around, the \"Nine Breaker.\" In Armored Core: Nine Breaker, players play through two main modes of play: training mode and arena mode. Training mode features 150 programs that test players' skills. Players can try out programs that focus on attack, defense, movement, \"technic,\" \"special\" and \"overall.\" Each of these areas are further divided, with attack comprised of multiple tests in accuracy, power, judgment, \"hit - single\" and \"hit - melee.\" Arena mode is a battle mode in which players take on other mechs in battle. Mech modification, the series' bread and butter, is of course featured heavily in Nine Breaker.",

In Resembool, Edward and Alphonse meet an enigmatic alchemist named Jack Crowley and an entity called the Phantom. It seems that they have some connection with both the disappearances and the strange creatures (known as Golems) appearing around the countryside. When sends the brothers and to investigate a village plagued by these monsters, they meet Arlen Glostner, an archaeologist who is studying the ancient civilization of Lebis. Edward and Alphonse soon find themselves headed for the ruins of Siam-Sid, the capital city of Lebis, to discover the truth behind the Golems and the puzzling disappearances.", 
        "summary": "Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir is the third Fullmetal Alchemist video game for the PlayStation 2 and is the second Fullmetal Alchemist console role-playing game for the PlayStation 2. It is the prequel of sorts to Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel. The game has much improved visuals than the previous title, as well as all dialog being voiced over. To help boost sales, Square Enix decided to release the game with a bonus DVD in the United States containing the second and third episodes of Season 2 (episodes 27 Teacher and 28 One is all, All is One\") of the 2003 anime series, since the show took a 4 month break in its Adult Swim broadcast. This DVD contains only English audio, with the shortened version of the 2nd OP \"READY STEADY GO\" by L'Arc~en~Ciel and the shortened 3rd ED \"Motherland\" by Crystal Kay, since that is the version that was to be shown in the Adult Swim broadcast. As of August 31, 2005, the game has sold 160 thousand units in Japan.",

In addition to the normal roles and duties of a Church, they also have a group of trained Demon Hunters called La Pucelle. Two of La Pucelle's newest members are Prier, a sixteen-year-old girl, and her twelve-year-old brother Culotte.\n\nIt is said that the Dark Prince, favored servant of the fallen angel Calamity, will rise to scourge the land. But legend tells that when the Prince arises, a warrior known as the Maiden of Light will challenge him and restore the balance of Light and Dark. Prier hopes to be the Maiden of Light.\n\nThe game's story is broken up into chapters. Each chapter has a number of endings, depending on the information La Pucelle discovers before reaching the chapter's end.", 
        "summary": "Prier and her brother Culotte are novices with the demon-hunting organization, La Pucelle. They've just passed their final exams and are ready to do real work fighting demons and zombies, but quickly find themselves embroiled in a series of plots orchestrated by a rival church with dark intentions. The gameplay is played on a tactical map, as teams up to six characters work to clear boards of enemies and dark energy. The unique \"purify\" command allows players to recruit monsters to their team and execute complex \"miracle\" energy attacks.\n\nThe game was ported to the PlayStation Portable in Japan on November 26, 2009 as La Pucelle Ragnarok.",

Together with Jigen and Goemon, Lupin seeks to steal valuable treasures out from under Inspector Zenigata's nose. Players have access to Lupin's wide array of gadgets and disguises, which allow him to pass by guards unnoticed or to get close enough to pick their pockets. \n \nAs a stealth game, Lupin the 3rd: Treasure of the Sorcerer King plays like an arcade answer to Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell. The game also has puzzles in the classic Resident Evil mode. Lupin plays out from a third-person perspective with a first-person free look option.",

Norstein, Yoshino \"Yoshi\" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a \"special genre\", called a \"Dramatic/Innovative RPG\", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.",

There, they find out that race of three-faced monsters, called Desert Lords, have been terrorizing the human population recently. In order to fight them, the humans need powerful allies. But the gateway to the world of dragons has been sealed, and only a dragon of the Elder Breed can open it. Rynn and Arokh must now venture to the dragon world, restore the bond between humans and dragons, and defeat the Desert Lords.\n\nDrakan: The Ancients' Gates is an action game with RPG elements. The player will take control of both Rynn and Arokh during the course of the game. Arokh's gameplay involves flying to distant lands and dealing with some of the more powerful foes. Rynn's gameplay has more RPG elements, as she can specialize in the arts of melee fighting, archery, or magic, acquiring experience from defeated enemies.",

The game differs from Monopoly in that players can buy and sell stocks of a block, affecting the value of block's stock up by buying or down by selling that block's stock or by developing a player-owned property of that block which increases the value per share for that block's stock. Also unlike Monopoly, it is not necessary to own the entire block to develop a property, though controlling more than one property of a block allows the player to develop their properties into larger buildings to collect more from opponents when they land on them. Players must collect a set of four suits, heart, diamond, clover and spade, to level up and collect additional gold when the pass the starting position/bank. To win a player must make it back to the bank with the board's required amount, which includes the total value of the player's stocks, property value, and gold on hand.",

At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes.\n\nBattle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay.\n\nClassic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game.\nStar Battle: Collect the most stars.\nCrown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game.\nPoint Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents\nReplay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.",

The game retains the action elements from its predecessor such as the use of multiple special weapons that can be upgraded by defeating enemies. Apart from the main character, the game features four playable sub-characters, each of whom shares a part in the story. The player's actions determine which characters will decide to help Jubei in his quest. These characters were added by the Capcom staff to give a bigger depth to the game and expand the game's feeling of adventure.",

Guitar Hero was released in November 2005 in North America, April 2006 in Europe and June 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks-like game to United States. \n \nThe game features a guitar-shaped controller (resembling a miniature Gibson SG) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music. The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks, in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. Guitar Hero became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications, and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century. The game's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise, which has earned more than $2 billion in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.",

        "storyline": "In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..", 
        "summary": "Take control of a fully armed prototype mechanized robot and fight off enemies during a space colony hijack in Hideo Kojima's Zone of the Enders. In it, players become the character Leo Stenbuck, who sees the consequences of fighting first hand as he learns the true meaning of life and death. Combining state of the art PlayStation 2 graphics, tons of weapons, and an involving storyline, Zone of the Enders also provides a dynamically changing mission structure, a versus mode for two players, and a playable demo of Metal Gear Solid 2: Snake Eater in all first-run production copies.",

Instead, the island seems pretty much the same as when he left, but people he knew changed and his rekindled friendship and relationship with people he left behind will bring a change in Kouichi. The game is a visual novel with light background animations, while character only change poses and don't animate during talking, even moving lips while talking and looking in a different direction is done via character stills and not animated. Aside from Kouichi, all NPCs feature full voice-acting. \n \nOriginally released as Clear for PC (Windows), this PlayStation 2 port was done two years after with reduced rating and removed adult content. To compensate for that, the game features new characters, new branching plot, new CG events and new opening song by Ceui. Gameplay interface has also been improved and adjusted for console gameplay.",

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (SD) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface. This makes it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces.\n\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast, the few social elite born commanders and some trained troopers, they all require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to the planet Helghan's atmosphere for long term period away from the planet. Unprepared, outnumbered and outgunned, Vekta's only hope rests with an elite squad of four soldiers who will turn the tide of the war.\n\nAs the climactic war razes across Vekta, Templar allies himself with troops on the outskirts of Vekta City, desperately repelling endless waves of besieging assaults from the imperious Helghast forces, but are eventually driven into a defensive retreat.",

Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the \"Sanctuary\" theme song instead of \"Passion\". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the HD 2.5 Remix release.",

The three great Katenas, chosen by the gods, are collectively referred to as \"Oz\".\n\nBoth humans and Katenas are overseen by the gods. As in Greek mythology, the gods are described as omnipotent, ambitious, self-serving, and power-hungry. The major source of their power is light; as they consume light, they cast parts of the world into darkness for centuries. The gods seek to destroy humanity and drain the planet's energy source, \"Etheria\".",

Just like the Dynasty Warriors series, the aim of these expansions is solely to add more content to the game. Players can use the \"Import\" feature (through switching discs with the original game) to use all features of the original game. Without the original game disc, the player will only have access to the Xtreme Legends content. This offers four new characters (Imagawa Yoshimoto, Hashiba Hideyoshi, Honda Tadakatsu and Inahime) and a brand new mission and map. This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Exclusive to Samurai Warriors Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features. These features include additional costumes for characters, voice sound tests, lowering the difficulty required to unlock the fifth and sixth weapons and the ability to break the default limits for character's stats. Methods of earning bonus points include the following: earning all of a character's endings, unlocking rare items and weapons and successfully creating new characters.",

        "summary": "A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for \"wanted\" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil. \n \nMetal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.",

While game retains the action elements from previous Onimusha, it offers a more varied amount of weapons as well as the option of going back to previous stage to unlock new content. The game also introduces a 3D camera as well as the ability to continuously fight alongside AI controlled characters who move depending on the player's orders. Dawn of Dreams was announced by Capcom due to high fan demand and several Capcom members realizing they could expand the action elements from Onimusha after working in Shadow of Rome. The game was designed in order to appeal to skilled gamers rather than the general market which resulted in appealing designs rather than realistic.",

The actual tournament follows over five days in which cut sequences telling the character's story are interspersed with matches. These are elimination-based, but there's the option to instantly replay a match that has been lost. The second day always features a mud match, and the fourth is usually a match of special significance, involving a shocking revelation or an encounter with a rival. The climax comes in a final boss fight against the mysterious Lady X and the resolution of the character's story. \n \nDefeating Lady X unlocks a new alternate story mode, featuring the characters alter-ego. It may be supposed that this takes place some time later after the character has 'turned'. In this mode, there are cut sequences only at the start and finish of the character's story. In between she fights a number of matches against various opponents (including one mud wrestling). The final match begins with a cut sequence, and is usually against a special rival (though in a few cases its Lady X again) and winning this match completes the story. It also unlocks a new costume.", 
        "summary": "Get ready for sexy yet challenging in-the-ring combat. WWX: Rumble Rose delivers intense girl-on-girl wrestling action with an all-female roster of vixens--each with specialty moves. The combat system lets you humiliate your opponents through insults, taunting, and aggressive moves and holds. Your player's costume, attitude, and wrestling style change depending on whether you fight dirty or fair. Naughty or nice, becoming a popular wrestler will earn benefits, including expanded gameplay, additional skills and moves, and more-revealing and flamboyant costumes.",

The path becomes one and it leads them to Castle Oblivion. The cloaked man appears as they enter the castle and gives them a card. They use the card to proceed through the castle.\n\nThe first world they go to is Traverse Town, where they discover that Leon, Aerith, Yuffie, and Cid have forgotten all about them. Strangely, though, they remember Sora, Donald, and Goofy's names, with Yuffie even mentioning that her heart still holds memories of them, even if her head doesn't. After Leon gives Sora a tutorial on fighting and gives Sora a summon card, they leave Traverse Town.",

Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air bike, a tank and a helicopter.\n\nThe player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen.

The survivors of the catastrophe live in floating harbours built of flotsam and jetsam, or on ships powered by old engines.\n\nGigantic marine monsters have suddenly appeared in the seas, roaming free and threatening the very existence of the survivors. In this society, some men have become Monster Hunters, big game bounty hunters who pursue the monsters of the deep for prize money.\n\nThese men sail the seas alone, sometimes never to be seen again, while others return to the harbours victorious, bearing the remains of the slain giants. In this new world, a young Monster Hunter is just embarking on his voyage to yet uncharted waters.", 
        "summary": "Deep Water is a single player action shooter game set in a post-apocalyptic world where the atmosphere has changed after an unspecified disaster. You now take on the role of a young man named El Shipak who hunts sea monster for a living. Six months ago Shipak has sighted a special monster and he is now obsessed with hunting it down.\n\nGameplay includes sailing around the oceans with El Shipaks boat. In the Oceans are floating harbors where supplies like fuel and ammo can be bought to hunt down the monster. Here the player can also buy better guns and upgrade his ship. At the harbor the player can also take on missions. Missions usually involve sailing to a certain area and gunning down enemies from the deck of your ship. Maneuvering the ship and fighting off the enemies can\u2019t be done at the same time. If fighting enemies the player can move freely across the deck of the ship.",

This version features a bonus DVD including an exclusive training mode (\"Starter's Guide\") and a documentary covering history of previous Hokuto no Ken titles for home consoles.

It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. \n \nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.",

In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as \"Musou Mode\"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).\n\nThe difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.",

But even if you don't know your \"rear differential\" from your \"toe-in\" you won't be left choking on the starting grid as Euro Rally Champion gives drivers all of the adrenaline and emotion of an arcade racer as well as the precision and realism of a true simulation. In addition to the single player Time Trial and Championship modes, you can go head-to-head in \"foot to the floor\" multiplayer sessions. Budding stunt drivers and those who simply fancy flipping their car without the risk of fractured limbs and bruised pride can even burn rubber on one of the special Extreme Exhibition stages. These are filled with mad jumps, perilous slopes and the chance to barrel roll your way around adrenaline-inducing arenas of motoring insanity.",

IF Mode allows the player to create their own team; Choosing such options as a leader (or creating their own leader), Their home base, which officers to start with, which technology group their faction is in and what units the player starts with.

You then are given the task of measuring her dimensions, chasing and then bringing her back down to size.\n\nYou take on the role of a Helicopter, Jet and Tank while Riho rampages around Japan causing destruction and mayhem. Gameplay varies from measuring Riho, chasing her down a highway and protecting her sleeping form from alien squids while flying over the ocean.\n\nAs this is a Simple 2000 game, Demolition Girl is short and simple. The controls for each vehicle are similar and the graphical style is more or less consistent with other Tamsoft titles in the Simple 2000 series.",

        "summary": "Forbidden Siren 2 is the second installment in the Siren series.\nThe game tells the story of several characters who become trapped on Yamijima Island, an island off the coast of mainland Japan. On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's \"monsters\", the shibito.\n\nThe game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past. The story can unfold in different ways with, in many cases, two or more different versions of a level, which will have slightly different objectives than the original. If the player is thorough and plays through these optional versions, the story and characters may develop even further than before",

        "summary": "\"Unlimited SaGa\" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.\n\n\"Unlimited SaGa\" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.",

        "summary": "Presenting a combination of monster breeding and RPG elements, Jade Cocoon 2 expands upon Genki's original title in a number of significant ways. Gameplay comprises a familiar mix of storytelling and monster raising, with significant tweaks implemented for good measure. The town acts as your base of operations and it's here you can stock up on supplies, or take jobs for which you can earn money and build a reputation. The latter proves vital as it's directly related to the number of monsters you can use in battle. The successful completion of certain tests rewards you with the ability to command more beasts -- up to a maximum of 12 at once, however, you can only take these tests when your reputation is high enough.\n\nThese trials take place in the Arena, which is also home to Beast Hunter battles, where you can test your mettle against fellow Beast Hunters. Monster eggs are found on your travels and can be hatched in the Room of Life; an all-encompassing monster management room that provides detailed information on the beasts and allows you to merge them, creating hybrid creatures. The monsters now also evolve over time. Your amulet consists of 12 slots, three for each of the four elements. Your creatures are placed in positions on the amulet corresponding to their position in battle, and during combat they'll attack the enemy and defend you from harm. Their amulet position also dictates the effectiveness of their elemental powers.\n\nThe storyline starts 100 years after the original adventure, with the Cocoon Masters having become the stuff of myth and legend. Beast Hunters are the modern equivalent, and players take on the role of Kahu; an aspirant Beast Hunter. A chance encounter results in Kahu being cursed, and he, along with a fairy named Nico, must rid his body of the curse or die. Levant (the original title's protagonist) is now a guardian and acts as your guide.",

Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul.\n\nKya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.\n\nYou'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!",

Ever since, watching her read has been the one source of delight in his otherwise uneventful mornings.\n\nIt wasn't that he wanted to go out with her, or even to be noticed by her.\nJust watching her from afar made his days a little bit brighter - and it's certainly not as if he believed in that charm that everyone was talking about...\n\nOne day, Makoto's classmate Sekai catches sight of Kotonoha's picture on his phone and discovers his secret affection for her. To Makoto's surprise, Sekai gives him her full and enthusiastic support. Her encouragment brings fresh color to his dull, uneventful life.\n\nFrom the moment she drags the two of them to their first lunch together, the barriers between Makoto and Kotonoha begin to fall. Sekai, however, grows increasingly distracted, as if lost in her own thoughts.\nOn the platform at dusk, Makoto waits for Kotonoha to arrive for their first date.\nSekai passes by on the way home from school.\n\nGrateful for her part in bringing him and Kotonoha together, Makoto promises to do anything he can to thank her.\n\nA moment later, Makoto stands there on the platform, stunned.\n\nOn the train, Sekai clasps her phone, a picture of Makoto set within.\n\nKotonoha hurries towards the station, a cheerful smile on her face.\n\nAnd so, as three hearts burn with three different emotions, the story begins.",

        "summary": "The second game in the The Chikyuu Boueigun series, renamed Global Defence Force for its English release (similarly the first game was renamed Monster Attack for its English release).\n\nIt's been two years since the invading alien menace was defeated by the Global Defence Force (the game renames the \"Earth Defence Force\" from the previous game), but like any good off-world threat, they're back for more, and they've brought new weapons and technology in their attempts to take Earth and eliminate humanity. Thankfully, the GDF has also been developing new technology to fight them.\n\nGlobal Defence Force is a third-person action shooter. Choose from either an GDF infantryman or the flight-capable Pale Wing, each with different abilities and dozens of weapons each, and set out to shoot down hordes of giant insects, enormous robots, and UFOs of incredible scale. You can choose two weapons to carry for each mission, and pickups dropped by enemies will unlock new weapons and increase your character's maximum health. You can play the game split-screen cooperatively.\n\nBeyond adding a second player class to choose from; the Pale Wing; a fragile but powerful melee centric character with a limited Jetpack and her own weapon set, to go alongside the infantry man of the first game, Global Defence Force doesn't change much of the basic game play of Monster Attack. But leaving at that would undersell the game; there are numerous new alien types, weapons and environments that add much more variety to things. The maps are larger and more detailed and missions are longer and much more scripted (where as the original game nearly always threw you into an environment against some preplaced bug's, this time you often have some simple objective(s)) to add further variety. Finally the physics have been notably enhanced.\n\nLike Monster Attack, the player in Global Defence Force fights completely by themselves despite being part of an army (unless playing offline only 2 player split screen); the original Japanese version features radio chatter from other GDF squads and your commanding officer, to give the illusion that you are fighting alongside others. This was cut from the English release.",

        "storyline": "The story is set one year after Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction and before Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, as that's when the Thirteen Devils broke up.\n\nIntro :\n\nThe \"Kaido Circuit\" extends throughout Japan. High-speed battles unfold as drivers enter all kinds of races, seeking to test themselves. Striving for the top, racers battle one another day after day.\n\nAt night, the dark side of the Circuit emerges: a private world known only to racers, where \"Survival of the Fittest\" is the only rule. Gossip leads to rumors, and rumors grow into the stiff of legend...\n\nOne such legendary racer once existed. He was called the Emotional King, a veritable god in the Kaido World. However, they say that he suddenly vanished after a race in Aso...\n\nWith the Emotional King gone from the Kaido night scene, two dominant figures emerged: Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit.\n\nThey came from Category Races and were already \"legitimate\" racers. These 2 are now rumored to be the best that Kaido has to offer.\n\nThen a legendary metropolitan team, The Thirteen Devils, apparently took it upon themselves to stem the flow of metropolitan racers crossing over into Kaido.\n\nCan anyone defeat the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit?\n\nWhat has become of the Emotional King?\n\nHas the Kaido Circuit really been overrun by the Thirteen Devils?\n\nAnd where is the next legendary racer?\n\nAs the battle begins, a team has been formed to fight against the 13 Devils: Kingdom Twelve, whom their leader's real identity is mysterious.\n\nIn the meantime, all Slashers (Stage 1 : MMC Ooaza and World Supremacy, Stage 2 : Haruna Guardian, Lonely Wanderer and Metal Wizard, Stage 3 : Final Leg, New Moon and Global Winner) and the double aces Yeti Fang and Murder Supremacy are preparing themselves as the 13 Devils may eventually challenge them.\n\nWhile everyone is ready, the player arrives and defeats every Slashers who ask if he/she would join them against the 13 Devils. Meanwhile, after Global Winner's defeat, Kyoichi Imaizumi (Yeti Fang) and Tastu Zoshigaya (Supremacy Murder), described as 2 witnesses of the last battle, discuss about that battle :\n\n\"What did you think of that battle?\"\n\n\"Hmm... He races rough, but still fast. He's obviously not from the racing circuit...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I agree. He came here on his own, and he's out to battle us now. We've got nowhere left to run. All we can do now is accept his challenge.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'll make it perfectly clear who the better racer is. My technique is tempered by experience, it's unbeatable. What I want to know is, where did he come from..?\"\n\nThen, both the Kingdom Twelve and the Thirteen Devils are being defeated one by one. Meanwhile, a person begins to doubt about the Kingdom's objective as it seems that the leaders are strangely friendly. Furthermore, after the player defeats Timber Slash, the identity of Kingdom Twelve's leader is revealed by her: Hamagaki, the former Emotional King, AKA Kaido President. Apparently, he lost against Kokami just before Zoshigaya beat him.\n\nAs both the Absolute Emperor and Miracles Summit were defeated, a new course has been opened : Hokkaido, where only the best drivers are there. By reading the messages, the player can see that the 13 Devils' leader is here : Motoya Iwasaki, AKA Speed King, and some legend drivers are here, such as God Shift Bunta, the High Empress (former Lovers' leader) and someone who drives a black and red Lancer Evolution III but no one can remember his identity.\n\nWhen the Empress is defeated, the real goal of the Kingdom Twelve is revealed by her as she was recruited by Hamagaki, but declined his offer : \"Kingdom Twelve's ostensible goal is to get all the Tokyo racers and all the highway racers under their thumb. Then, once they've conquered the highways, they'll transform into the ultimate rally team and make a new start\", meaning that Hamagaki wants to build his own \"racing utopia\".\n\nAs Kaido President and Speed King are defeated, the black and red Lancer Evolution III is revealed to be the long lost Emotional King : Taiju Kokami, who wanted to make a fresh start as Emotional King. After his defeat, a new team shows up after the great battle : Revival Of Sodom, lead by Zaiga Koshigaya, who appears to have known Kokami for a long time as he was his friend. Even though Zoshigaya is one of the best drivers, he lost to them, so everyone asked if the player can do something about them as the new legendary racer.",

        "storyline": ".hack//G.U. takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the year 2017. As depicted in the first .hack game series, the \"2nd Network Crisis\" was an incident that occurred seven years ago in which many computer systems across Japan malfunctioned. Through the efforts of those games' hero, Kite, the incident resulted in the birth of Aura, the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making decisions for itself. Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period.\n\nIn late 2014, Aura disappears, resulting in the slow decay of The World and the Internet as a whole. In response, the company that administrates The World, CC Corp, sets up \"Project G.U.\" and tasks them with remedying the problem. They come up with the \"Restore Aura (RA) Plan\", in which they attempt to retrieve the fragments of Morganna\u2014an AI that served as Aura's \"mother\"\u2014and seal them into player characters (PCs) of The World. In theory, this would allow the Project G.U. programmers to manipulate the Morganna program to recreate Aura. Only certain \"chosen\" players could control these special \"Epitaph PCs\".\n\nAfter locating candidates to operate the Epitaph PCs, the team proceeds to test the RA Plan despite concerns over \"anti-existences\" that might damage the Internet. The program fails catastrophically and destroys over 80% of the data for The World.[9] Instead of trying to salvage the data, CC Corp develops The World R:2 and releases it to a new generation of players. However, this new game is less popular than its predecessor and becomes plagued by \"player killers\" (PKs), players who target other players for fun and sport. The Epitaph PCs which had been lost during the RA Plan disaster resurface in the new version, attached to certain players of interest.\n\nVol. 2: Reminisce:\nIn Reminisce, Haseo and the G.U. staff find themselves trapped inside the game, physically unable to leave or log out, or remove their hardware. Atoli recovers, but is rendered mute, able to communicate only through instant messages. Yata explains that AIDA has copied The World's server, trapping everyone inside to experiment on them. After cracking into the administrative control area, they transfer everyone back to CC Corp's servers. Shortly afterwards, Haseo is approached by Alkaid, concerned for Sirius, a player infected with AIDA. They enter into a tournament to fight Sirius, but Alkaid is ambushed by the AIDA-infected player Bordeaux, who leaves her in a coma. After learning that Sakubo is another Epitaph user, Haseo requests Endrance's assistance for the rest of the tournament. They defeat Sirius and purge him of his AIDA infection that contained Atoli's Epitaph.\n\nWith Atoli's Epitaph returning, she also recovers. However, her superior from the guild Moon Tree, Sakaki, causes Atoli to slide into a depressed fugue, and be used again by AIDA. Sakaki attacks his own guild, Moon Tree, in order to drive Atoli to the point where she will utilize her Avatar to actively support the AIDA infestation in order to control the real world through the Net, using AIDA as a cat's paw. Haseo liberates Atoli, removing her infection, and driving off Sakaki. Tracking Sakaki, Haseo defeats him after he purposely infects himself with AIDA in a last-ditch effort to gain control of the network. Following this, Ovan appears and reveals that he is Tri-Edge, infected in his left arm with AIDA. The enemy that Haseo believed was Tri-Edge was actually Azure Kite, one of three AIs that Aura had created to destroy the AIDAs.", 
        "summary": ".hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce is the second entry in the .hack//G.U. series containing: Vol. 1: Rebirth, .hack//G.U. Vol. 2: Reminisce and .hack//G.U. Vol. 3: Redemption. As in the previous .hack games, .hack//G.U. simulates a massively multiplayer online role-playing game as the player controls a character who starts playing it.\n\nPlayers assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called The World. While in The World, the player controls the on-screen player character, Haseo, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player may control the camera using the game controller's right analog stick. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as \"Root Towns\" that are free of combat. They also can \"log-off\" from the game and return to a computer desktop interface which includes in-game e-mail, news, and message boards, as well as desktop and background music customization options. In Reminisce, an optional card game called \"Crimson VS\" becomes available. The player may save the game to a memory card both from the desktop and within The World at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series. This can also be applied to previous games if the player first finished the Reminsce or Redemption.\n\nPlayers can attack monsters in real time. However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Haseo, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (\"Free Will\", \"Rage\", \"Life\", etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters. Monsters roam the environments freely or guard treasure chests. Once combat is initiated, via a \"surprise attack\" or the player being spotted, a wall erects around the combat area to prevent escape. Weapons give the player access to the Skill Trigger feature which allows them to perform a powerful attack at the cost of losing SPs. As an adept rogue character, Haseo can wield multiple weapons for close combat. Although Haseo can only use one weapon per battle, during Reminisce the player can change weapons in the middle of Skill Triggers. Under certain conditions, the player may execute an enhanced type of Skill Trigger called \"Rengeki\". These attacks deal greater damage and fill a Morale gauge, which allows the player and his team members to use a combination attack. Certain plot-related fights, called \"Avatar battles\", use a different interface which incorporates shoot 'em up gameplay elements. After depleting the opponent's health, players must charge up a \"Data Drain\" to end the battle.\n\nRoot Towns are non-combat areas in The World. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other \"players\" of The World. The player may also undertake optional quests and visit guilds. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called \"servers\") as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A password system controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.",

        "storyline": "The plot of Scars of the War revolves around USN soldier Walter Feng. When Huffman Island is deemed ready for colonization by the United Nations in 2065, Feng becomes one of the island's first immigrants. Living in Freedom City, Walter befriends two other children - Randy O'Neill and Glen Duval. The three boys experience first-hand the realities of war during the outbreak of the 1st Huffman Conflict in 2070; Walter and Glen are literally scarred by shell casings during a battle in Freedom City. The three boys were separated at the end of the war when the USN forcefully repatriates Walter and Randy, and Glen is forcefully repatriated by the OCU. The three reunites during a peacekeeping operation as soldiers for their respective armies during the Huffman Crisis in 2086. Upon seeing Glen pilot a wanzer, Walter and Randy sign up for the USN Army's wanzer training program. As tensions between the OCU and USN elevate to a new high from the Larcus Incident, the two men qualify as wanzer pilots.\n\nHowever, on the same day they qualify, Walter and Randy are sent off to fight in the 2nd Huffman Conflict. During the invasion of Freedom City, they encounter Glen in the suburbs of city and defeat him. Feng and O'Neill visit Duval before he is shipped off to a POW camp. A year later, the three face off again on the battlefield - this time, Glen easily defeats his friends. However, instead of showing mercy, Glen kills Randy inside his cockpit block. A ceasefire between the OCU and the USN is declared shortly after he escapes. Traumatized by the experience, Walter cleans up Randy's quarters in an attempt to move on with life. Seeing an application form for the Strike Wyverns assault unit, Feng signs the form and undergoes intensive training. He passes the test and joins the unit, where he meets his old friend Edward Collins and new commanding officer Lynn Wenwright (who happens to be his childhood sweetheart).\n\nOver the next few years, Walter participates in numerous military operations and begins to take an interest in the conflicts he gets involved with. From Zaftra's struggles involving natural resources to pro-independence movements in the OCU, Feng gets drawn into a global war between nationalism and globalization that has been on-going for decades. At the heart of this conflict is the Grimnir - a terrorist organization aimed at destabilizing the supranational unions and return to a world governed by nation-states.", 
        "summary": "Front Mission 5: Scars of the War is the fifth in Square's Front Mission tactical RPG series. It brings the player back to a gritty futuristic world in which conflicts are waged between five world powers: the U.S.N., O.C.U., E.C., O.A.C., and the Republic of Zaftra. Such conflicts are waged with the wanzer, Front Mission-speak for mecha.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a true return to Front Mission 2 roots while incorporating various features from Front Mission 1, 3, and 4. The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots.",

Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with \"ARMs,\" or \"Ancient Relic Machines,\" which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three \"Dream Chasers\" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.",

Foul monsters known as \"Legions\" were unleashed by the Clan against their enemies in their bid for domination. However, powerful heroes called Forces soon rose up to lead the charge against them. Aided by Force Frames, ordinary warriors became gifted with a variety of powerful advantages that made them more than what they would have been otherwise. With this, the war against the Clan of the Moon began to turn. The Clan's Dark Castle and the Legions were banished in the end. Victory was achieved, but only at a great cost. Several nations were utterly destroyed and most of the Forces that participated in the final battle had perished.\n\nWhen the story starts, a young warrior named Max has nearly completed the training that will make him a Force. Journeying home, he hopes to achieve his dream, not realizing that it is only the beginning of an adventure that will take him and his friends across the world to stop the return of evil.", 
        "summary": "Max completes his Force military training and returns to his village to meet his family and to find news of his missing brother. Later, the village is attacked by monsters later suspected as remnants of the Legion as well as the appearance of a mysterious figure that seems to know of his brother. This reasons compel Max to seek out the Legion threat, hoping in the process to also find his missing brother.",

The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. It is collocated with the S. P. U. and Rinkernator and is the main server for the tower. The Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. The Sol Marta satellite is a relay station used to increase the range of Song Magic usage of the first tower, so it works with the same kind of hymmnos and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. Plus, it also has the function of receiving energy from the first tower and sending it to the second tower. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the Pastalia hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns.",

Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans. \n \nJake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.",

While Ed moans, Al consoles, and Armstrong flexes, the train is suddenly attacked by terrorists. The skirmish eventually ends with one destroyed train and the brothers in the town of New Heissgart, looking for a ride to Central. There, they meet a girl named Armony and learn more of the Philosopher's Catalyst, an item nearly as powerful as the Philosopher's Stone itself, but used to increase the efficiency of alchemy. The Philosopher's Catalyst seems to be directly linked with the berserk chimeras running about, the rogue military force, and the gathering of alchemists in the town. The Elrics soon find that their simple mission for a train turns into much more as they learn about the Catalyst and the dark mysteries surrounding it.",

Tokyo is plunged into chaos and now two more cities want to compete: Osaka and Nagoya. The racers here will have to beat every team in these 3 cities, and maybe, have the opportunity to challenge the best drivers in each: Speed King & Dejected Angel in Tokyo, Seeks, Genesis R & D3 in Nagoya and No Loser & Darts in Osaka.",

This entry in the series was released two years after the previous game, Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero.\n\nMuch like other entries in the series, the objective is to become the fastest racer on the highways of Japan, but unlike those before it, TXR3 allows the players to race in Nagoya and Osaka instead of just Tokyo, and the Tokyo map is expanded to include the Yokohama area. In addition, this title adds a weather cycle.\n\nTXR3 includes a fully-licensed list of cars from a variety of Japanese, American, and European manufacturers instead of the old car model designation method of \"Type-(technical model name)\", and furthermore, the car list itself was culled of many repeat models so to simplify and reduce the number of cars. The A, B, and C car designations were also removed.\n\nGraphically speaking, Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 is a definite improvement over previous entries. Car models feature a higher polygon count and are much more extensively detailed and lighting effects were also greatly improved, featuring light streaking effects, road reflections and higher quality car reflections.",

The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don't level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.",

The Island, a massive fragment of a long-lost planet, hurtling blindly through space. Upon the surface of this paradise wanders the giant, Kabuto. Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers. In their pride, they created Kabuto, as a defense against intruders. But Kabuto became conscious of himself, his loneliness, his pain - and he went berserk.\n\nSpace castaways, the Meccs piloted their ship through space, looking for their missing friends. If you haven\u2019t guessed already, they ended up on the Island. Faced with yet another unscheduled layover while on their way to Planet Majorca, the Meccs decide to make the best of their temporary home. Just their luck - the natives are already embroiled in their own little war, and the Mecc visitors are most unwelcome!\n\nMeccaryns... Sea Reapers... Kabuto... One island isn\u2019t big enough for the three of them.",

During his quest, he meets many characters from classic Disney films and a handful from the Final Fantasy video game series.", 
        "summary": "Kingdom Hearts is an action role-playing game developed and published by Squaresoft for the PlayStation 2. It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.\n\nKingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.\n\nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.",

This hotel of the undead is filled with a bizarre group of guests -- along with Gregory and a mischievous little punk kid called James. Your goal is to steal the soul fragment (contained in milk bottles) that each guest holds. Doing so will, as Death informed you, get you out of the hotel, and apparently fill you in on why you were out walking about in the forest in the first place. You obtain the soul fragments by interacting with guests and solving basic puzzles. The game ends when you've run out of spirit as indicated by a spirit meter.",

        "summary": "Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco's Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides.\n\nIn-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls.\n\nThe game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking.",

        "storyline": "The game begins with Vetch (voiced by Steve Tarlow) receiving a transmission from his lieutenant, Overlord (Jason Gregory), who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice. Rather than kill Haven, Vetch decides to watch him, hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage. Meanwhile, in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra, Haven (Jake Rosewall-Gallagher) is completing his latest invention; a mechanical bird named Talon. Upon finishing, Haven heads to work in the mines. However, upon entering, he sees his friend Chess (Regan Kerwan) being questioned by a guard. The guard tries to shoot Haven, but misses, and causes the mine to collapse, knocking out Haven.\n\nHe awakens under the treatment of Dr. Spong (Andrew Silber), who tells him Chess hasn't been seen since the collapse. Setting out to find her, he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle, as they planned. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams. She refuses to tell him anything, and Haven intervenes, killing Overlord and freeing Chess. They escape, and Chess says that while in detention, she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes. Haven decides he must speak to this slave.\n\nHaven heads to the Isle of Heroes, and meets the Wise Man (Terry Bertram). He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain, and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice; Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years, and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, he was unable to even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, he left behind the Golden Bell, but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote. Making the people of Aurias his slaves, he sealed off the Mount of Sighs, on which resides the Golden Voice. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias, the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash, and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount.\n\nHaven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. However, as he escapes Firash, he is captured and placed in the Sylex, a space station prison. He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco, a planet populated by lizard-like humanoids. He soon meets brothers Chill (Dale Stump) and Will (Aubrey Hodges). They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoid-like creatures. Haven does so, however, the insect queen attacks the local village. Haven defeats her, and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer. He then heads to Auria.\n\nHe makes it to the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess. She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlord's castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves. Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven.\n\nThey pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship, and the duo escape. However, Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along, who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.\n\nHaven escapes, but is unable to free Chess, and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone, promising to return for Chess. He returns to the Mount of Sighs, where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead. He then kills Athellion. Haven confronts him, but Vetch defeats him. However, the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive. As such, Vetch ties Haven to a rock, pointing out \"you can't live forever\" and leaves him alone on the planet. The game ends on this cliffhanger.", 
        "summary": "The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.",

However Achille proves too powerful and strikes down Maximo with one blast of his dark magic, killing him. Now floating in the underworld, Maximo is approached by Grim who reveals that Achille is drilling into the underworld to harvest souls, fueling his undead army. Feeling that he would be out of the job if there are no more dead, Grim makes a deal with Maximo to bring him back to life in exchange for stopping Achille's evil plans; sending him back to the earth in the process where his journey begins.",

An evil wizard named Darsul has cursed the three adventurers, causing their souls to become entangled as one. Only by exploring an ancient and mysterious land will they be able to free themselves. \n \nUnlike the first title, where players switched back and forth between two different adventurers, this incarnation follows all three characters. While only one character can be controlled at any given time, all share the same life bar referred to as a Soul Gage. Each character also has distinct physical and magical attacks to use on enemies. \n \nGathering items and weapons plays an integral role in character development, as the leveling-up system found in traditional RPGs has been eliminated. Instead, a character's attributes are influenced by his or her equipment. Not only do changes made to an outfit alter ability in battle, but they affect the way other characters perceive players as well. \n \nDepending on how NPCs perceive them, players may receive cheaper items or be given information they would not otherwise be privy to. A character's weapons, clothes, and items are shown in real time, thus any changes made will instantly alter his or her outward appearance.",

The 100 top scorers will be recognized through an interactive ranking system, letting novice players test their dancing mettle against top-notch DDR experts. Players can also go online to access new challenge missions which will be refreshed periodically, allowing players a way to continually expand the DDR gaming experience. Whether players are looking to dance to the hottest tracks in town, choreograph, edit and create their own dance steps, or use the 'Work Out' mode to burn off excess pounds, DDR STR!KE will offer players of all ages an interactive and fun way to get up and groove. The game's support for the EyeToy Camera continues to add depth and dimension to the gameplay. While using the camera, players can access fast-paced mini games and use both their hands and feet while dancing and watching themselves on TV. Keeping players on the dance mat is more than 100 minutes of energetic dance music, including exclusively-licensed dance hits as well as smash-hit songs, such as \"Genie In A Bottle\" and \"Oops!...I Did It Again.\" Also adding to the impressive line-up of songs is new music by the famous video game musician Yuzo Koshiro, whose credits include composing music for hit games such as Streets of Rage series, Revenge of Shinobi and Shenmue.",

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (SD) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface. This makes it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces.\n\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast, the few social elite born commanders and some trained troopers, they all require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to the planet Helghan's atmosphere for long term period away from the planet. Unprepared, outnumbered and outgunned, Vekta's only hope rests with an elite squad of four soldiers who will turn the tide of the war.\n\nAs the climactic war razes across Vekta, Templar allies himself with troops on the outskirts of Vekta City, desperately repelling endless waves of besieging assaults from the imperious Helghast forces, but are eventually driven into a defensive retreat.", 
        "summary": "Set in the near future during a period of planetary colonization, Killzone drops you in the middle of a war between the ISA Command and a militaristic separatist faction, the Helghast. As one of four ISA members, your initial objective is to escort a high-ranking official to an evacuation point. You can experience several gameplay modes, including single-player, multiplayer (team-based and competitive), and online play for up to 12 players. Players can equip themselves with an armory of more than 27 different weapons based on modern technology.",

The game now got some different part since the player has to manage the eatery and the waitresses, all of whom are lovely and potential love interests. During each week he has to decide about the coffee shop menus, the prices, what will be the waitress duties during that week and also what he is going to do that week (he can study management, rest, etc.). There are some times during each week that the player is giving some choices (like in all visual novel adventures) and depending of them the game ending will be different. If he got success he can buy new coffee shops, new waitress dresses, etc.",

A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.\n\nFor battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game).\n\nMorale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale.\n\nThe game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.",

Earth is safe because of its atmosphere, but it seems that humanity is doomed to an isolated existence.\n\nWhen machines known as Volgara begin destroying the Earth, the player must pilot the only weapon on Earth capable of standing against the invaders. Along the way, lives will be changed, history will be made, and the origins of the Volgara will be revealed.", 
        "summary": "Robot Alchemic Driver is a Big Robot/Monster fight in a modern city with a twist. There is a story and training mode and a 2 player vs. mode. In a nut shell, alien's attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the \"hero\" (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot/hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building/terrain as you battle the alien monster.",

Before the beginning of every week in the game's storyline, the player is given the option to plan a schedule, and is allowed to pick and view any three days of the given week. Different events occur depending on the days that the player chooses. Every so often, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. Depending on which choice the player makes, the \"tear points\" of the heroine associated with the events of the day would either increase, decrease, or remains the same. \"Tear points\" act as a system notifying the player how well he or she is treating a certain character. If a character's tear points exceed the maximum amount of eight, her ending is rendered inaccessible during that specific playthrough. There are multiple plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times and make different schedules and choices during decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction.",

In order to survive in the harsh environment, these people mutated to the point of no longer remaining human. They developed a passionate hatred for mankind, and eventually formed the Helghast Empire, attacking the planet Vekta controlled by the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA). As Helghast soldiers invade the planet's perimeter, the ISA forces are trying to hold the ground and find a way to stop them.",

Up to sixteen players could compete in the online multiplayer portion, which includes eight maps and six modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Assault, Defend and Destroy, Supply Drop, and Domination. The online servers of the game have now been closed down.",

        "summary": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo is an action game based directly on the Mobile Suit Gundam films and series. The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space. \n \nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films. \n \nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\". \n \nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. \n \nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.",

The main character, Chihiro Enomoto, was chosen by lot as a candidate for the next student council, and he and his partner had to undergo rigorous training and trials in order to become a member of the next student council.\n\nThe main part of the game is a 3D action that goes through an automatically generated dungeon in Ryubashiin Gakuen. If you choose one of your favorite characters before the start of the stage, subcharacters will follow and you will move on to the stage with a total of three people. A partner may initially be in a blunt \"tsun\" state, but regaining a damaged partner can increase his/her popularity, and a \"dere\" state can give him/her an advantage in the progress of the game.",

        "summary": "Formula One 05 for the PlayStation 2 was released in Europe on July 1, 2005, and in Australia later that year. It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.\n\nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n\nSee also[edit]",

But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction.\n\nThe fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.",

        "storyline": "Stella Deus takes place in a world called Solum, which is slowly being swallowed by \"Miasma\", a mist-like substance that destroys all life it touches. Against this creeping apocalypse, several groups have developed responses. The Aeque Church, led by High Priestess Lumena, believes that the Miasma is God's will, sent to bring the world to an end, not with a bang, but a whimper. A warlord, Dignus, has taken to ravaging the countryside with his armies, imposing the law of the jungle: he who will not fight for his life does not to deserve to live. And finally, an alchemist named Viser is using Dignus's patronage to hunt the world's Spirits (polygonal creatures whose nature is unknown), draining their life-force to fuel his alchemic inventions, which he is sure will save the world. His friend and deputy, Spero, is the game's protagonist. Spero must make his way through this muddy political situation and see if he can save Solum.", 
        "summary": "Stella Deus is a story-driven tactical role-playing game in which the player controls a group of characters both picked up during the course of the story and in side events. The world is navigated using an overworld map using point-to-point navigation, with a date system showing the length of time it takes to get to a selected location. Alongside the story missions, Towns can be visited, in which characters can customize and create new weapons and armor, sell existing equipment in exchange for money, and shop for items such as healing potions. In camps set up on a journey, characters can swap out weapons and armor, equip items such as healing potions and beneficial charms for future battles. Special items used in character leveling can also be crafted by the player. Alongside story-based missions, there is a special dungeon called the Catacomb of Trials, where characters can battle and gain experience levels, raising their general statistics. The number of available levels in the Catacomb increases as players progress through the game. Each character has a specific character class, which they keep throughout the game and continue to level up as they gain experience points (XP). Higher amounts of XP are awarded for executing special abilities. Along with swordsmen and archers, there are alchemists (mages), priests (healers), and units who fight using most things from axes to fists.\n\nMost battles are triggered based on story events, and are completed when the stated object has been accomplished by the player, be it defeating all enemies, defeating a boss, or performing a specific task. At the end of each battle, the players gain a summery of their performance and spoils gained. The game uses the turn-based Replaceable Action Position battle system, much of which was carried over from the battle system used in Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth. Players navigate the field across a grid-based map, which can include obstacles such as bodies of water and high structures. Character positioning within the environment can be used to their advantage, such as an archer gaining higher accuracy when at a high point in the level. Character actions are arranged in a set order, and each character's weapon dictates their attack range. Each time a character performs an action, they gain experience points and additional Skill Points (SP) that can be used to purchase supplies or raise individual character stats. Three types of Skills can be equipped for characters: Action Skills, a special attack that player execute for a certain amount of Magic Points (MP); Support Skills, which grant passive abilities such as scaling higher obstacles; and Zone Skills, which grant passive abilities to both the equipped character and those in close proximity to them.\n\nAlongside Action Skills, two or more characters in conjunction trigger unique special moves called Team Attacks. The amount of damage done depends on how many characters took part in the action. Team attacks also increase the rewards gained at the end of battles. Characters' actions are governed by their stored Action Points (AP): a character's turn begins when their AP meter is at 100. A character's actions can continue until the meter reaches 0, meaning that they can move and attack multiple times within their turn. The amount of AP used with each action depends on the weight of the armor the character is wearing.",

        "storyline": "God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army. \nKratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos. \n \nAfter a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue.", 
        "summary": "God of War II is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released for the PlayStation 2 console on March 13, 2007, it is the second installment in the God of War series, the sixth chronologically, and the sequel to 2005's God of War. The game is based on Greek mythology and set in ancient Greece, with vengeance as its central motif. The player character is protagonist Kratos, the new God of War who killed the former, Ares. Kratos is betrayed by Zeus, the King of the Olympian Gods, who strips him of his godhood and kills him. Slowly dragged to the Underworld, he is saved by the Titan Gaia, who instructs him to find the Sisters of Fate, as they can allow him to travel back in time, avert his betrayal, and take revenge on Zeus. \n \nThe gameplay is similar to the previous installment. It focuses on combo-based combat which is achieved through the player's main weapon\u2014Athena's Blades\u2014and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features quick time events that require players to quickly complete various game controller actions to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared to its predecessor, God of War II features improved puzzles and four times as many bosses. \n \nGod of War II has been acclaimed as one of the best PlayStation 2 and action games, and was 2007's \"PlayStation Game of the Year\" at the Golden Joystick Awards. In 2009, IGN listed it as the second-best PlayStation 2 game of all time, and both IGN and GameSpot consider it the \"swan song\" of the PlayStation 2 era. In 2012, Complex magazine named God of War II the best PlayStation 2 game of all time. It was the best-selling game in the UK during the week of its release and went on to sell 4.24 million copies worldwide, making it the fourteenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. God of War II, along with God of War, was remastered and released on November 17, 2009 as part of the God of War Collection for the PlayStation 3. The remastered version was re-released on August 28, 2012 as part of the God of War Saga, also for the PlayStation 3. A novelization of the game was published in February 2013. \n \nThe European/Australian PAL version was released as two different editions: a single-disc standard edition and a two-disc \"Special Edition\" with different box art and a bonus DVD.",

There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).",

        "storyline": "Two years after defeating Clockwerk, Sly Cooper breaks into the Museum of Natural History in Cairo to steal the Clockwerk parts and destroy them to end his threat against Sly's family for good, but discovers that the parts are already missing. Inspector Carmelita Montoya Fox and her new partner, Constable Neyla, confront Sly, but he escapes before Carmelita and Neyla can arrest him. Before making his escape, Sly hears Neyla suggest that the evidence actually suggests that the Klaww Gang stole the parts for their own use.\n\nThe Cooper Gang heads to Paris, where the first Klaww Gang member Dimitri is using Clockwerk tail feathers as printing plates to create counterfeit money. Sly and the gang shut the operation down and Dimitri is arrested by Interpol. The gang then heads to India, where the second Klaww Gang member Rajan puts Clockwerk's wings on display at a ball he is hosting. Rajan is also the kingpin of a local crime syndicate that grows and sells \"spice\", an illegal plant indigenous to the Indian jungle. Also present at the ball are the other Klaww Gang members and several undercover Interpol agents, including Carmelita and Neyla. The gang steals the Clockwerk wings in the middle of the ballroom while a disguised Sly creates a distraction by dancing with Carmelita. After the Cooper gang escapes with the Clockwerk wings, Carmelita blows her cover and starts making arrests. The Klaww Gang flees the scene, and Rajan goes into hiding somewhere deep in the jungle. The gang tracks him to his spice-growing facility in a long-abandoned temple, where he is using half of Clockwerk heart to super-irrigate his spice crops. He carries the other half of the heart on the end of a staff that he carries with him at all times. The gang steals both halves of the heart and incapacitates Rajan, but Carmelita, Neyla and the Contessa arrive. Neyla frames Carmelita of working with the Cooper Gang on the night the Clockwerk wings were stolen. She betrays the Cooper Gang and puts Sly, Murray, and Carmelita under arrest.", 
        "summary": "The sequel to Sly Cooper delivers the same crime detective style of presentation, borrowing heavily from movies, novels and comic books to create a beautiful, highly animated game. The story takes place two years after Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. In the first game, Sly was becoming a professional thief, but in Band of Thieves, he is a professional thief -- so he retains all of the moves from the first game. He also earns new moves and gains different items to assist him in his dark craft. The biggest upgrade comes in form of the new multi-character gameplay. Players might start a level as Sly, and then after completing a particular task, players switch to Bentley, and Murray, respectively.",

Bill Rizer, the hero of the Alien Wars, was held responsible for the incident, as well as for murdering his partner, Lance Bean, who reportedly tried to stop him. He was given a sentence of 10,000 years in cryogenic prison.\n\nHowever, five years later, in 2647, Earth faces another threat as the terrorist organization \"Blood Falcon\", led by a mysterious and superhuman commander, spreads panic over the world. The ruling government, referred to as the \"Triumvirate\", decides to release Bill Rizer prior to completing his sentence, in view of his previous successes in defending Earth, in hope of neutralizing Blood Falcon. Lucia, an advanced cyborg soldier built by the government from Dr. Geo Mandrake's research, is sent to accompany and assist Bill's endeavors. Bill eventually finds out that Lance is still alive and is in fact the commander of Blood Falcon himself.\n\nAfter defeating Lance, it is revealed that the aliens from the past games attacked because the Triumvirate secretly stole a mysterious, powerful \"Relic\" from them. With this information, Bill and Lucia have to confront Triumvirate and uncover the secret of the alien Relic.",

The soundtracks for each game are from the arcade version, with the exception of Alpha 2 Gold, which uses the arranged soundtrack from the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions. The original Alpha gives player a choice between CP System and CPS II-style soundtracks (the former is based on the CPS Changer version of the game).\n\nAll the games in the compilation includes the standard Arcade, Versus and Training modes, as well as Survival mode and Dramatic Battle for the Alpha games. The Dramatic Battle mode featured in the original Alpha, Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 Gold is the same one featured in the Japanese arcade version of Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, allowing players to create their own team of characters and fight against a specific series of opponents (Adon, Sagat, M. Bison and Akuma). The original Dramatic Battle mode from the first Alpha, which features Ryu and Ken against Bison, is still available in the game as a secret feature.",

The Devil blood has been taken over from generations to generations, but she doesn't have enough power to take over the position. The current Devil gets weaker, and it's time to transfer the position to the successor. One day, the news comes out that someone, who lives in the human world, is nominated for the next Devil. Soon after the news comes out, a terrorist group attacks the castle, and Ashe runs out of the castle with Kyle. They run away into the forest, and accidentally fall into the hole to the human world and lose their magic power. They roam around the human world, and bump into twin brothers Leni and Seizh, who are the nominees for the Devil. Ashe asks them to come to the Devil world as soon as possible, but they are not interested in the position.

Now a new Corporation has entered the scene; this Corporation, Navis, while nowhere near the size of the other Corporations, does have a trump card; it has complete control over a brand new and very useful resource, and they do not intend to share. The other Corporations obviously will not sit back and let that stand, so they set up contracts with Ravens through Raven's Ark. Of course, Navis is employing the use of the Ravens as well, and a full-scale conflict seems apparent on the horizon. Once again, you are thrust into the lines of corporate warfare, but does something even more dangerous lie in wait? It is the sequel to Silent Line: Armored Core.",

When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals.\n\nThe player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class.

No item fetching is required, however the ninjutsu scrolls come in handy, and some levels require Hotsuma to break stone pillars to continue. Shinobi also contains combo features. One of these features is called a \"tate\" kill, whereby if enemies are killed in a chain, a cutscene will play killing all enemies at once and dropping more Yin for your blade. The other feature is that as Hotsuma kills with his cursed blade \"Akujiki\", the sword will change different colors indicating different damage multipliers.",

The player takes control of Leonus & Ainna, two adventurers that wake up in a cave to find out that not only they lost their memories, but are also sharing the same body. They go on a journey to look for the mysterious Nova, who might know something about their past. The character you choose at the start becomes the lead in the story and the true owner or the body, the other one still participates in the plot as a sub-protagonist. Normally, they are not able to talk with each others, but using the \u201cStone of the Everlasting Night\u201d they can meet inside an artificial world.",

The two scenarios are very similar and basically follow the same story: you live in modern-day Tokyo and one day discover a strange symbol in an old storehouse. As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the anime series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home.\n\nThis is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters.",

Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.",

Gil puts on a suit of armor that radiates light, and proceeds into the dungeon to save his beloved Ki. \n \nThe combat system and exploration might be the best part of the game. The map is set up in a grid, and you do everything in turns, like moving, battling, or recovering. The timing of moves is also critical, and the game feels like a real-time game because you aren't waiting like you typically would for turn-based games. \n \nThe Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino dungeon is a collaboration between the Mysterious Dungeon series and the arcade classic The Tower of Druaga.",

        "summary": "Long, long ago, the real world and dream world were one and the same. But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.\n\nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.\n\nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.\n\nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.\n\nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.",

Players can select from among different styles like hip hop, pop, trance, garage indy, and metal, then add, mix, and modify clips from the thousands available to create their own unique songs. HITZ FACTORY also supports USB microphones, so players can even record their own music or vocals to include. Vocals will be analyzed and a new musical riff will be created based off of player's pitch and range. Players can then hear what they just sang as if it was played on a guitar, the drums, or other instruments. HITZ FACTORY also lets players create music videos to go with the music by blending several of the more than 500 clips available into their own video. Up to four different clips can be layered together then mixed with different effects like color, kaleidoscopes, and more. Finally, the DJ Supermixer mode lets players be the DJ with a set of virtual decks to spin. Players who want to work in the music industry or create their own music will love FUNKMASTER FLEX DIGITAL HITZ FACTORY. By turning the PS2 into a recording studio, musicians will be able to make their own songs in no time.",

The three realms are largely independent and their natives are suspicious of the other realms. Many humans have been convinced of the evil nature of Hell by the angels, but for all their fearsome powers neither the devils nor Hell itself are inherently malevolent. Hell is ruled by the beautiful and compassionate Jenarose, who is said to love humankind more than anyone in the world.",

He has recently been revived, but has lost all memories of his previous life. With the war between Demons and Angels still continuing with no end in sight, he must restore his power and build his forces back up to strike back against the Angel Army.\n\nBlack/Matrix II is a turn-based tactical strategy game similar in structure to Final Fantasy Tactics, and the sequel to Black/Matrix. Characters level up and learn abilities individually, and it is possible to recruit a variety of characters, though only 6 at a time can be deployed into a battle. There are also several different romantic interests to pursue, with multiple endings for each depending on the player's choices throughout the game.",

The vessel crashes before reaching its lunar resort destination, however, separating the just-married couple and leaving the hero alone at an abandoned research base. Players explore the station from a first-person perspective, inside a spacesuit. In addition to the many spiritual anomalies that haunt the forgotten station, strange lunar lighting and relative weightlessness add to the atmosphere of the game's environments.",

The previous game's producer, writer and character designer returned to their respective roles. The game was designed as a more mainstream game in light of the previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay.",

Heading out with his senior partner Anna Steele, Lazarus sets off on what he believes is a routine call but, in the true spirit of survival horror, it's not long before the crime-bothering duo are knee-deep in ectoplasm. After much bickering between the pair, Jones somehow inadvertently sets free a horde of ghosts contained in the school's secret paranormal research lab. An errant apparition materialises, grabs Anna, and drags her away with him to a dark, eerie place (the school canteen, perhaps?). One of the wayward spooks (Astral) also manages to 'bond' with Jones, giving him the gift of supernatural sight, allowing him to see dead people. Nice. Picking up the reins as Laz, you'll start out in search of Anna, and attempt to figure out the mysteries buried deep in the school's past along the way...",

The game is a simulation of hunting in a world filled with deadly monsters. Like actual hunting, successfully killing or capturing a monster requires the use of strategy, skill and provided items. Monster Hunter sold poorly in Europe and the Americas due to being given no advertising; however, it was a huge hit in its native land, Japan.\n\nAfter January 1st, 2008, the online servers for Monster Hunter in North America and Europe were shut down, and thus online play for the PS2 version of Monster Hunter is no longer available. With the Monster Hunter online server being inactive forever, the gameplay population among MH fans has greatly decreased because offline mode provides fewer choices of weapons and armor.",

The full power of the PlayStation 2 is on show in 60-frames-per-second motion with motion-captured players animated down to their hair and shadows, all shown in action with nearly 50 different camera positions for soccer action right out of broadcast TV. 18 International teams and 32 American squads line up and shoot hard with bicycle kicks, fakes, and headers. Soccer America features a balanced Easy Play mode to let beginners get into the game, while pro fielders will find the sharp AI more responsive to your fancy moves on the turf than the average soccer sim. With a Multi-Tap (for PlayStation 2), up to four players can call their formations and drive to the net, so limber up and spit out your orange rind--soccer action is calling.",

The game's combat system is turn-based at core, but requires the player to press buttons in a rapid succession and with precise timing to execute attacks. The characters can store up energy to unleash a stronger attack later. Using the technique named Carta, they can also perform various special moves which are based on elemental affinities.",

Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell. \n \nEphemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific location at a specific time.",

Super DBZ is a cell-shaded fighter featuring your favorite Dragon Ball characters. Each character has his own special abilities, with Frieza making use of warps and Trunks using swords for up-close attacks. The game uses a four button setup. Two buttons are reserved for strong and weak attacks. One button is used for guarding with another used for making your character jump. The guard and jump button can be pressed together to execute a dash move. Super DBZ features both ground-based and air-based fighting. Stages are multi-layered, and you can move between different areas, taking the fight to an area that's more advantageous to your character.",

The main threat humanity has to face is the appearance of a super-powerful alien race called the Gnosis. The story picks up just after the concluding events of the first episode. Shion Uzuki, the young engineer who designed the powerful android KOS-MOS, arrives with her friends at the planet Second Miltia. They aim to learn more about the heritage of the late genius scientist Joachim Mizrahi, and foil the schemes of the mysterious antagonists Albedo and Margulis. Jin Uzuki, Shion's brother, who was only mentioned in the first chapter, becomes an important controllable character in the second episode. Much of the plot's content is dedicated to exploring the past and the origins of Jr., as well as his connection to Albedo.",

A brand new story drives the missions as players experience the trials and tribulations of a ninja-in-training - fierce competition from fellow students and constant challenges from their teachers.

With familiar characters like Kakashi, Sasuke and Neji that can swoop in for assistance, Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles offers mini-games and lethal attacks straight from the popular anime series to satiate any aspiring ninja.",

Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.\n\nGrandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.",

The title takes place in 2004 some six years after the events that transpired in Resident Evil 2. The government has destroyed the Umbrella Corporation, which has been behind just about every plot and disgusting bio-chemical mutation in the survival horror series. Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President's daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo's next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.",

The remake actually uses an earlier version of the DQVIII engine developed by Level-5, making the only instance of a hardware's remake title launching before the next main entry.

WWI finally broke out in 1914... eventually the war ended, but a lot of countries still held animosity with each other.\nIn 1923, Erika, a mechanic, and her family lived in Juktland. Her father, Anthony, was also a mechanic. Though he was old, he was still called the 'God of Repair'. Erika was also a good mechanic. One day, Anthony received a command from the Juktland Army. It was to be a airplane mechanic for the Roby Independent Aerial Platoon. Erika didn't want him to overwork himself, so she said, \"I'll go in behalf of him.\" Like this, she was sent to an air base near the border. However, when soldiers first saw her, some despised her, some expected something from her, and some felt disappointed... No one treated her as a full-fledged mechanic... She finally said, \"I'm here as a mechanic. Give me something to do!\"",

In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases.\n\nThe player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.",

        "storyline": "The setting is Valdolla, a large city completely surrounded by snow-capped mountains.Edward, Alphonse, and Winry meet Sophie Belkman, a fourteen year old girl with silver hair and light blue eyes who has been cornered by Leonid, the guardian of ice. When Edward's attempt to save her from him fails, she uses a strange power causing a blinding golden light to light up the entire sky.\n\nAfterward, Leonid retreats, and Sophie passes out. The trio run to her aid. Soon after they've learned each others names, Sophie takes Edward and Alphonse and presses her seal, (A transmutation circle shaped like a flower) onto Edward's right hand, and Alphonse's shoulder, increasing their alchemic abilities.\n\nThey sought out the Guardians of Ice, Wind, Earth, and Fire to get closer to solving the mystery of Velza. During this time, they progress through an ancient castle, where on the balcony, Sophie experiences strange pulsations accompanied with voices that make her scream. A strange transmutation circle is inscribed in the ground right by a rock-like platform that has handcuffs hanging down from chains to suspend someone.\n\nAhead, the balcony overlooks the mountains. Sophie and the Elric brothers are surprised by Romeo Craigin, who are then taken into Custody by Venus Rosemaria and her subordinates Izzy Trigger and Boris Hammer. Edward yells for Sophie to escape. Alphonse is strapped to an Electrical machine for testing, and Edward stripped and locked in a cold jail cell with nothing but his boxers to stay warm, but Edward finds a way out and they escape the military base together.\n\nUpon fighting and defeating three of the four guardians twice, the brothers discover that they lose their power, and wither away into dust. Sophie saves Leonid who has been lifted from his curse, but is only shot and killed by Romeo Craigin moments after the trio leave the area. The brothers' journey finally comes to a close after reaching the highest level in the Shrine of Velza, where they find Sophie who has been possessed by Velza because of the red rock that Zelgius placed in her chest, and break her out of the trance.\n\nThey fight Velza as a disgustingly ugly and enormous monster with a skull for a face. Upon defeating Velza, she gets sucked into the ground but re-emerges again in a human form covered with blood and glowing eyes, creating a massive vortex of wind and red light in her rage. Sophie approaches her, and despite the fact that Velza attacks her twice, she still survives almost unharmed (except for some bleeding on her forehead). Sophie then wraps her arms around the angry Velza, crying, and her words cause Velza to calm down, and she hugs her in return. Her eyes are shadowed out, but a tear falls and lands on Sophie's face where she begins to wither to dust. Her gentle eyes are revealed for a split second, and her last word being a \"thank you\" before vanishing for good.\n\nAfterwards, all of the monsters that were summoned when Zelgius initially placed the red stone in Sophie's chest, vanished as well, leaving citizens and military soldiers alike thankful and relieved that the terror was finally over. Zelgius, who is standing on the balcony with Roy Mustang notices that everything's vanished, and after saying his final farewell, he sets himself on fire and disappears into the air. They return to the Church to find Winry and Sophie's beautiful white cat, Norn, and decide to have a nice walk in town since they no longer had anything to worry about.\n\nOn the way through the empty streets, Edward is pushed back by Winry, as she is deeply immersed in a conversation with Sophie, which causes him to fall behind the other three. In a shadowed alley, Toriga stands covered with a blanket, muttering and holding a large dagger. He has gone insane from his friends death by the flying monsters. The moment Edward reaches the alley, with his friends far ahead, Toriga lunges out and stabs Ed in the chest, then walks away, causing death on impact.\n\nAlphonse, Sophie, and Winry turn around after hearing a thump from behind them and run to Ed's side, crying in shock. After seeing Ed lying motionless, Sophie decides to use her power to bring him back to life. She places her hands over the wound in his chest and a light starts glowing. She meets Edward (who is floating upside down) in a beautiful looking place with a sunset on one side and the daylight on the other and talks with him. Edward screams her name out before she vanishes, and realizes that he's alive again (reaching out for Sophie).\n\nWhen he turns, he sees Sophie sitting with a blank and vacant expression, and Winry sobbing uncontrollably by her side. He then suddenly realizes that something is wrong, and moves to her, screaming and touching foreheads together. Edward and Alphonse meet F\u00fchrer Bradley at the Headquarters which turns into a fight, where winning or losing will change the ending.\n\nUpon losing the battle, Edward is struck unconscious by Major Alex Louis Armstrong where he and Mustang speak with the F\u00fchrer, who then enters the HQ and kills Romeo Craigin. Winry and the Elric brothers try to speak to Sophie who is vacantly staring out the window not even aware of their existence. They leave Valdolla in grief and sorrow.\n\nMustang and Hawkeye are treated for injuries at the Hospital. At the very end, Norn continually meows trying to get Sophie to come back to reality, and just when hope seems lost, Sophie stresses out the words \"Norn\" and \"Ed\" with a smile.\n\nIf you win the battle the scene with Norn still plays out but she runs from the hospital to the train station, recovered. Although she first believes her friends have already left, she succeeds in reuniting with the gang.",

Like other games in the R-Type Series, the game is a scrolling shooter where you need to guide a spaceship through various stages and destroy the many enemies (including very large end of level bosses).\nThe game features a large variety of spaceships (over 100!) to choose from, each with varying capabilities. Regardless of which ship you choose, you begin the game with limited firepower; you can fire a basic weapon, or hold down a button to charge up and fire a more powerful burst. Occasionally power ups will appear on the screen; collect these to equip your ship with additional weapons, including a variety of lasers, missiles, and other useful items. In addition to the normal game, an AI VS mode is also included. In this mode, you can set up one of your available fighters to be controlled by the computer and then fight it to see who wins in various battles.",

The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?\n\nBloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called \"DNA points,\" which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.",

Another, played after Sora speaks to Kairi in the underground waterway in Traverse Town, showed Riku lost in the Realm of Darkness after Ansem, Seeker of Darkness took his body. There, he is assisted by King Mickey who reveals that he has the realm's Keyblade. Neither of these cutscenes used any new audio and instead the subtitles were seen on a black screen.\n\nAn optional cutscene was a confrontation between Cloud and Sephiroth, seen after the player defeats Sephiroth. Cutscenes were provided for the Unknown, using spliced voice acting for Sora and Goofy, but shaking text on a black screen for the Unknown.\n\nA minor cutscene was also added near the start of the game on the second day on Destiny Islands, where it is revealed that the lucky charm Kairi makes out of Thalassa Shells is the Oathkeeper charm she later gives to Sora.", 
        "summary": "Originally released only in Japan on December 26, 2002, Kingdom Hearts Final Mix has several events and a number of gameplay tweaks that are not in previous releases. Spoken dialogue is in English, with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku's journey and foreshadowing of Kingdom Hearts II, were included, but no new dialogue was recorded. A gameplay option allows the player to skip cutscenes after seeing them once. The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with a new fight against \"Unknown Man,\" in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel.",

Depending on the amount of magic ink expended, and the types of body parts, the creature will be given certain statistics and created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.",

        "storyline": "The story of Shadow of the Colossus begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge at its entrance on his horse, Agro. According to Lord Emon later in the game, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land. Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several shadow-like creatures with humanoid forms appear and prepare to attack Wander, but he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession, which emits strong beams of light. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as \"Dormin\" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which it states may be possible, but only if the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall are destroyed. It explains that this task can only be accomplished by using the ancient sword to kill sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Each contains a portion of Dormin's own essence, though this is not revealed until late in the game.\n\nDespite a warning from Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them. In a sequence after the eighth's slaying, a deterioration of Wander's body is shown clearly\u2014his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon.\n\nUrged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge, which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. As Agro jumps over the last gap in the bridge, the portion which is landed on begins to separate from its foundation, causing Agro to nearly lose footing. Sensing the impending fall, Agro jerks forward to throw Wander to safety on the other side, making a sacrifice for him and falling into the river hundreds of feet below as the bridge finally gives way. Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus, and Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship just as the last temple idol crumbles; Wander appears soon afterwards, his eyes and skin now both entirely pale, and two small horns protruding from his head. Declaring that Wander has been \"possessed by the dead\", Lord Emon orders his warriors to kill him. While he struggles to reach Mono, one warrior shoots Wander in the leg with a crossbow, while another stabs him through his heart with a sword. Black blood sprays from the wound as Wander's body becomes covered in darkness and falls to the floor\u2014a death identical to those suffered by the colossi.\n\nAfterward, Dormin's spirit possesses Wander's body, transforming it into a shadowy giant. Dormin, now speaking in its masculine voice, explains that it had been separated to sixteen pieces\u2014the colossi\u2014to seal away its power, and that by entering Wander, who absorbed physical form from defeating each colossus, it is now whole again. While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall, creating a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander. Emon and his men flee the forbidden land as the bridge connecting to the temple collapses behind them. As they safely arrive at the entrance to the forbidden land, Emon expresses hope that if Wander survived, someday he may be able to atone for his crimes.\n\nIn the temple, Mono awakens, restored by Dormin in accordance with its agreement with Wander, and Agro limps into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male infant with tiny horns on his head. She takes the child with her, following the horse to higher levels of the Shrine of Worship, and arrives at a secret garden within the shrine as the game ends.",

An elite pilot using the codename Mobius 1 is sent on a number of missions to fight Eruseans and help ISAF to win the war.

Eighteen missions will take the player from search-and-destroy buildings to one-on-one and all-on-all dog-fighting. Along the way it becomes possible to upgrade the fighter with defense systems, deadly weapons, and other accessories.",

        "summary": "Genki's racing games have typically fallen into the Shutokou Battle series, a collection of late-night racing games that put you on the highways surrounding Tokyo. The company's latest PS2 racer, Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, maintains many of the same gameplay mechanics that Genki's other games contain, but this time it takes the cars off of the streets and drops them onto proper racetracks.\n\nRacing Battle will contain licensed cars. The version on display only has a handful, including an RX-7, a Supra, an Integra, an Impreza, and an S2000. The car models in the game look decent. They're nice and smooth, but they don't seem to be quite as detailed as the car models in some other comparable racing games.\n\nLike most other racing games, Racing Battle has multiple camera angles. But the first-person angle is pretty interesting. From this view, you get indicators that show how hard you're steering, accelerating, or braking. You also get a second, TV-style camera angle in a small window at the top of the screen. This is cool because it gives you a good idea of what's going on near your car. It's easy to see cars coming up behind you with this view and more effective than a standard rearview mirror.\n\nThe gameplay in Racing Battle is roughly the same as what Genki has done with Shutokou and Kaido Battle series. Each car is associated with a fighting gamelike life meter, and the car in second place constantly loses pieces of its life meter. When one car runs out of \"health,\" the race ends and a winner is declared.",

Fast-forward to the year 2009: the player takes control of Raiden, a rookie agent operating under the order of the Colonel, apparently a member of a reformed Foxhound unit. His initial assignment is to infiltrate the offshore clean-up facility Big Shell and rescue the President of the United States of America, who was kidnapped by members of a terrorist organization known as Sons of Liberty. However, the matters become increasingly complicated as almost everyone Raiden communicates with appears to have things to hide, and it is hard to tell a friend from foe...", 
        "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the espionage action game Metal Gear Solid. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets and defeat the tricky boss enemies. The game expanded its predecessor's cover mechanic, with Solid Snake or Raiden able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player. Metal Gear Solid 2 is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as a leading example of artistic expression in video games.",

        "storyline": "Lupine III and his inseparable companions Jigen and Goemon run to the rescue of the beautiful Fujiko who got into a big trouble: the woman was in fact kidnapped by the band of the Celestial Dragon at whose command is the ruthless Kourin, a terrible twenty year old with incomparable techniques of struggle and powerful performer of mysterious martial arts, which hits Lupine in a vital point with the deadly Dark blow, leaving the thief gentleman only three days of life. In order to save himself, Lupine must get hold of Sokai's treasure (it is said that there is a cure in the treasure that could heal from the dark blow), through a series of clues written in the Book, aka the Pink Crystals (accompanied by the Black Crystals in the second narrative strand of the game), which however are the prize up for the winner of the Miss Sokai competition. Fujiko signs up for the beauty contest, but a problem arises: it is the beautiful Ginrei, a girl so charming that she even arouses admiration of the impassive Goemon. As if this were not enough, the inspector Koichi Zenigata, bitter enemy of Lupine III, senses that the next target of the protagonist will be the Pink Crystals and then rushes to Ginrei to warn her about Lupine and to supervise her in order to keep her safe . The first encounter between Zenigata and Ginrei is not the best: she invites him to leave her alone because the young woman is convinced that she is out of any danger, while he considers her a vain girl and dad's daughter (not knowing that in reality the young it comes from the outskirts of Sokai, a very unreliable and above all very poor neighborhood).\n\nLupine, meanwhile, fearing that Ginrei could steal the title of winner from Fujiko, plans to sneak into the girl's hotel to secretly give her a dose of sleeping pill that will make her sleep for two days. But since Zenigata was there to guard the girl, the gentleman thief was tracked down twice (first in the restaurant where Zazz\u00e0 and the girl had dinner, then in the young girl's apartment after Lupine had managed to escape all the policemen who were patrol), but both times he quickly manages to escape. In the meantime, the relationship between Ginrei and Zenigata is notably changing: between the two an agreement begins to arise, Zaz\u00e0 no longer thinks that the young woman is only a presumptuous egoist, while the latter sees in the inspector a figure that protects her and who is always present next to her in times of need. In other words, the spark of love began to ignite.\n\nThe day of Miko's competition arrives: Fujiko and Ginrei parade on the catwalk with elegance and, above all, unparalleled seduction. But between the two it is Fujiko to tick it, undoubtedly more loose and sexy than the opponent, decidedly more shy and reserved. Armed then with pink crystals and the blessed Miko (Fujiko), Lupine and the woman hurry to reach the Government Palace of Sokai where the treasure is said to be hidden. The protagonist escapes all the traps and deadly traps hidden by the building; Meanwhile Zenigata tries to improvise a speech to herself to console Ginrei, when suddenly she feels that she is talking to Kourin, the architect of the Dark Strike who sentenced Lupine to only three days of life. Zazz\u00e0 discovers that Kourin is none other than Ginrei's brother, who wanted his sweet sister to win Miko's contest in order to obtain the Pink Crystals that will lead the terrible boy to Sokai's treasure. The inspector bursts into the room where Kourin and Ginrei are conversing, but the boss of the Celestial Dragon treacherously shoots the poor Zenigata, who fortunately manages to save himself thanks to the bulletproof vest he had worn to protect, if necessary, Ginrei. Kourin thus rushes to the Government Palace to prevent Lupine from taking possession of the treasure; the head of the celestial dragon reaches Fujiko and the protagonist, and informs the latter of the fact that the medicine capable of healing him from the Dark Strike is the so-called Fog Flower, a flower, in fact, capable of totally eliminating the effects of the terrible kill shot. To prevent the thief from continuing further, however, Kourin strikes Fujiko with the tremendous Dark Strike, unleashing the wrath of Lupine who, furious as ever, kills the boss of the Celestial Dragon gang through the blows of his infallible Walther P38 (in the second the final of the saga, instead is Zenigata to finish Kourin, to avenge the sufferings that the latter caused to his sister Ginrei).\n\nLupine thus manages to take over the flower of fog, making Fujiko drink the only purifying drop, which recovers and can barely see the smiling face of the thief, who falls apparently lifeless to the ground. Fortunately, the woman kisses the protagonist to thank him for saving her life,",

Winning medals in a variety of events unlocks new courses, characters, and boards, as well as improved the boarder's abilities. New outfits may be earned by completing a character's trick book, by doing a number of specific tricks during play. Three kinds of boards are available to players: trick-oriented Freestyle boards, all-around BX boards, and racing-oriented Alpine boards, which are not meant to be ridden backwards. The courses are located around the world. The snowboarders also come from around the world, and speak in their primary languages.",

        "storyline": "Gekibo 2 is the sequel to Gekisha Boy. It is a fast-paced side-scrolling game where the player controls the junior photographer Pete Goldman working for the newspaper Planet Times in Japan. In each stage the goal is to photograph as many weird or funny situations as they occur in the environment while the screen scrolls to the right automatically. The player has minor control over the character's movement as the focus is on moving the cursor used to snap pictures. It is possible to capture any part of the environment and pictures are lined up in the bottom right side of the screen. Correctly captured gags and unusual situations remain there, while the others fly away and are discarded. A score is built up based on the performance.\n\nThis second game uses a different graphical style, replacing the flat 2D design with full 3D stages allowing for vertical movement while the characters are cut-out sprites similar to PaRappa the Rapper. This 3D depth introduces a new function where it becomes possible to zoom in on action in the background. It is now also possible to lock the cursor, useful to line up shots while avoiding hazards. A flash ability that clears the entire screen removes all obstacles such as a skateboard for instance, but can also reveal secrets such as hidden scenes and areas, and even completely new levels. It can only be used a few times per level shown through the number of bulbs available in the bottom left corner.\n\nSnapping situations provide film rolls that act as \"ammo\" that can be picked up and are required to keep on photographing. Often quick reflexes are needed so as not to miss situations or to avoid obstacles. Compared to the first game the amount of film is more generous, but the action is now much faster. Collisions with hazards can also be avoided using a new dash move or by snapping them. Some of the locations in the game are The Ginza, theme park Harajuku, spooky spot Odaiba, downtown Katsushika, gynmnasium Yoyogi, the historic town Tsukiji and the zoo in Ueno. There are three difficulty levels.\n\nPhotographs are stored in an album as a way to get an overview of every possible scenario to capture. There is support for the PlayStation Printer peripheral where the front page of a newspaper can be printed with one of your pictures in a prominent position. Pictures from the album can be printed as well. Picture Paradise is supported too, allowing players to use a camera to insert themselves into the game. That way the game can be personalized by giving random pedestrians the faces of friends or family members.",
