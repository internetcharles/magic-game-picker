The final game in the series released for that platform, PachiPara 14 once again simulates a handful of Sanyo's Umi Monogatari line of pachislot machines, specifically the CR Super Umi Monogatari in Okinawa MTA and SAD models. It is also the last game to feature the long-running PachiPro F\u016bunroku subseries as an open world RPG; while the name went on to reappear in the series 3DS' installments starting with the first release of PachiPara 3D: Taikai Monogatari 2, it transitioned into a predominantly visual novel genre in the wake of series producer and longtime Irem developer Kazuma Kujo leaving the company in March 2011 to form Granzella.",

The series is a younger brother to the Madden NFL series.\n\nIn July 2013, the NCAA announced that it would not renew its licensing contract with Electronic Arts because of an ongoing legal dispute regarding the use of player likenesses in the games. However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game. However, EA Sports is still making an attempt to get the series back going.[2]",

It was released in July 2007 in North America and Europe, and in August 2007 in Australia.\n\nPlayers use a guitar-shaped controller (purchased separately) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player. Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, rather than a full sequel. No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game. As implied by the game's title, the game features a 1980s theme, consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters, fashions, and artwork that reflect the time period.\n\nThe game was not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band.[5] The next major installment of the series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.[6]",

When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years.

        "summary": "SkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. \n \nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.",

Its action based on the real Master Rallye, the game takes place on a stretch of land that spans Paris to Istanbul, all of which is detailed in full 3D. Priding itself on state-of-the-art vehicle models, MASTER RALLYE is packed with obstacles and hidden bonuses throughout. As would be the case in real life, drivers must parlay quick reflexes and immediate, sharp tactics with a more advanced understanding of strategy, patience, and opponent psychology. Originally released on the PC, the game is the perfect fit for the memory-intensive PlayStation 2 console, and features white-knuckle two-player action.",

Taking the situation seriously, the Ministry of State Happiness urgently summoned a scientist as a \"koufuku sousakan (happiness manipulator)\" with the authority to manage Clover.",

The player acts as an officer in charge of managing the virtual space, and aims to normalize the people he or she contacts while observing the life of any \"avatar\" living there, to protect the avatar from frequent attacks by obstructionists, and to collect and redistribute the feelings of happiness and unhappiness that they emit, in order to achieve a certain level of happiness for all people. Avatar behavior changes in response to happiness and can be influenced by other avatars involved in life. That is, even with the same avatar, life can change depending on the degree of happiness of the other avatars that are actively acting or negatively distressed by the sense of well-being during observation, or are involved with or in contact with other avatars that were previously offline. The interaction between people is called \"human scramble\" on the package and official website. Each avatar lasts about 20 minutes, and you can watch the same avatar over and over again.\n\nThe whole story is represented by 3DCG, but the avatar is represented by flat shading (a projection method that looks like an angular figure with fine planes). Avatar conversations and thoughts are expressed as text, and their voices are expressed as indistinct voices.",

The protagonist has to cultivate the continent within that time to save its trapped inhabitants and release the mysterious seal.",

This place bears a strong resemblance to Kyoto at the end of the Heian period, where the Minamoto clan (Genji), led by Minamoto no Yoritomo (based on the historical Minamoto no Yoritomo), is at war with the Taira clan (Heike), led by Taira no Kiyomori (based on the historical Taira no Kiyomori). The Heike hope to defeat the Genji by releasing vengeful spirits to disturb the Earth's natural flow of energies and to terrorize the land. The boy that Nozomi met is revealed to be the human form of Hakury\u016b, the White Dragon God said to protect Ky\u014d, whose powers have greatly weakened due to the presence of the onry\u014d. Nozomi discovers that she has the power to seal the onry\u014d as Hakury\u016b no Miko, and she allies herself with the Genji in order to seal the onry\u014d, restore Hakury\u016b's powers, and return home to her own world.",

Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.\n\nThe game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.",

Training mode features 150 programs that test players' skills. Players can try out programs that focus on attack, defense, movement, \"technic,\" \"special\" and \"overall.\" Each of these areas are further divided, with attack comprised of multiple tests in accuracy, power, judgment, \"hit - single\" and \"hit - melee.\" Arena mode is a battle mode in which players take on other mechs in battle. Mech modification, the series' bread and butter, is of course featured heavily in Nine Breaker.",

While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market. \n \nThe player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. \n \nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.",

This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close.

        "summary": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo is an action game based directly on the Mobile Suit Gundam films and series. The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space. \n \nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films. \n \nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\". \n \nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. \n \nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.",

        "summary": "Formula One 05 for the PlayStation 2 was released in Europe on July 1, 2005, and in Australia later that year. It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 season each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet. The cover athletes are Jenson Button, David Coulthard and Narain Karthikeyan.\n\nPlayers start out testing for a smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot-out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time.\n\nAs with F1 04, \"classic\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France([citation needed])) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 season, this game runs the original \"aggregated times\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 season in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \"Butterflies & Hurricanes\" from English alternative rock band Muse.\n\nFor the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI.\n\nHowever, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the hardest of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \"drive-through\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.\n\nSee also[edit]",

Terrorist attacks have increased severely, which is why big nations of the world decided to form the UPF, \"United Peace Force\", replacing the UN and NATO. It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide.\n\nBut there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals.\n\nThe player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo.",

During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, Persona 3 includes elements of simulation games, as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle.",

In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases.\n\nThe player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.",

        "summary": "SSX is the first in a series of snowboarding video games which specializes in extreme sports titles with an unrealistic or arcade feel, including exaggerated jumps, highly decorated mountain runs and improbable trick. Winning medals in a variety of events unlocks new courses, characters, and boards, as well as improved the boarder's abilities. New outfits may be earned by completing a character's trick book, by doing a number of specific tricks during play. Three kinds of boards are available to players: trick-oriented Freestyle boards, all-around BX boards, and racing-oriented Alpine boards, which are not meant to be ridden backwards. The courses are located around the world. The snowboarders also come from around the world, and speak in their primary languages.",
