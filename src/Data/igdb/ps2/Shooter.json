        "summary": "Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 is a survival-horror game released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 and a sequel to Resident Evil Outbreak, which was originally envisioned as a much larger game before being cut into multiple releases. The same eight characters from the first title return with similar abilities, and the game takes place once again in a zombie-run Raccoon City. The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe.\n\nThe locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.",

In each level, the player can choose from one of two characters specific to each mission, and must kill enemies as they move through the level to retrieve an object and then carry that object to the exit portal. After a player picks up the object, TimeSplitters, evil mutant creatures, spawn endlessly throughout the level and attack the player.",

There are six multiplayer modes and aspects of each mode - such as the weapons and levels available, the winning condition, and managing characters.\nThe game contains a level editor that allows the player to create their own level from a selection of various pre-made tiles. Light settings of the tiles can be edited individually and items can be added to the map.",

        "summary": "SkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. \n \nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.",

The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins. \n \nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter. \n \nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity. \n \nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.",

In this third-person action-adventure, a cult of demons known only as the Grigori (and who, incidentally, have been masquerading as humans for the past 2000 years), are intent on resurrecting their master, Asmodeus. Doing so will bring about a cataclysmic end to all of humanity. As both, Mike Leroi and his alter ego Shadow Man, players must explore six worlds; each with numerous sub-locations, in their quest to prevent these vile creatures from bringing their diabolical scheme to fruition.\n\nWhen engaged in combat Mike LeRoi can attack with a bevy of armaments, running the gamut from powerful projectile-based weapons to short-range melee ones with which to bludgeon an opponent to death with. Additionally, it's possible for players to equip a different weapon in each hand, or alternatively, to equip a single, heavier two-handed weapon. When wielded by Shadow Man himself, weapons take on additional properties. A lock-on cursor can be used to target specific enemies, allowing the player to dodge and attack with consummate ease. Interspersed throughout the title are puzzles that must be solved in order for Shadow Man to advance through the worlds.\n\nThroughout the quest Mike will experience constantly changing weather and time; day changes to night, and back again in real-time, with inclement weather prevailing in many parts of the game world. Returning to the fold are Mama Nettie and Jaunty, two of Shadow Man's cohorts from the original title, while Thomas Deacon, the wheelchair-bound guardian of an ancient book the Grigori are after, makes his debut appearance. Shadow Man: 2econd Coming features mature, violent themes that touch upon subjects such as religion and voodoo. The cut-scenes feature character dialogue that is equally adult oriented.",

She uses the Insignia to enter the church, then solves the light puzzle later seen with Leon to ring the church bell, although bringing down the steel bars that prevented Leon from getting to Ashley.",

But a former friend from his MI6 days arranges to rescue him and offers him a job, having planned in advance to manipulate him so that he is unable to refuse. The first task seems fairly ordinary: to track down a weapons dealer who has been supplying terrorists.",

The occupants of this warehouse include a kindly looking old doctor, and a man with a notable scar on his face. Mika arrives, and the man with the scar claims the contents of the case: two massive handguns. That man is revealed to be the game's title character Grave, and now that he is armed he can start his mission.\n\nGungrave first approaches its stages as a series of missions issued by Dr. T, first to gather information on the current makeup of Millennion from a low-level street gang, and next destroying a research facility that creates Harry's undead soldiers. In the third stage, while attempting to pump information from an informant, Grave comes into contact with the leadership of the Millenion organization\u2014once friends and allies that he now faces as enemies. Each have used the research Harry supported to give themselves inhuman powers. From here on, Grave is hounded by each member as he makes his way to Harry's tower at the heart of the city.",

The player takes on the role of a marine in the Pacific campaigns and both British and American soldiers in the European campaign. Unlike the PC \"World at War\" titles, Final Fronts has a training level. The War in the Pacific and Victory in the Pacific Campaigns see Private Joe Miller (a reference to World at War protagonist C. Miller) and his fellow soldiers Sgt. Roebuck and Pvt. Polonsky (also in World at War) fight their way through Japanese defenses on Guadalcanal, Betio, Saipan, and Okinawa. A major difference in the American campaign from World at War is the fact that both Roebuck and Polonsky survive the final battle for Okinawa (also, Sgt. Roebuck shares a similar character model to Sgt. Dixon from Call of Duty 3). The Winter Offensive and Victory in the Europe campaigns have three protagonists: Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the US 80th Infantry Division of George S. Patton's Third Army, Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airborne Division, and Gunnery Sergeant Alex McCall of the US 4th Armored Division. The Winter Offensive campaign sees the Americans and British move to relieve the city of Bastogne (while the 80th take Ettelbruck in Luxembourg), and the Victory in Europe campaign sees the British 6th Airborne Division capture the town of Weser during Operation Varsity and the Americans capture Adolf Hitler's birthplace of Braunau-am-Inn in Austria.", 
        "summary": "Call of Duty: World at war - Final Fronts is a first-person shooter game. It focuses is on single-player campaigns, as it has no multiplayer. The game is set in World War II. The player can carry two guns at one time, as well as grenades. Levels are played with a team of soldiers from both Britain and the U.S, that assist the player by killing enemies and completing objectives. The game has been criticised by some critics for the poor AI, which is evident when friendly soldiers push you out of cover and into the enemy line-of-fire.",

The game is played in two camera angles: the player moves from a third-person perspective while walking, which changes to a first-person perspective while aiming the gun. You'll pick up several guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle. But like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently and ammo can be very scarce.",

        "storyline": "At the height of the Cold War, America's greatest agent known as The Boss defects to the Soviet Union. At the same time, an extremist named Colonel Volgin fires an American-made portable nuclear missile at the Soviet design bureau OKB-754, sparking an international incident. In order for America to clear its name and avoid World War III, a man named John and codenamed Naked Snake is dispatched by the special forces unit FOX to assassinate the woman who taught him everything.", 
        "summary": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the prequel to the entire Metal Gear series. Most of the series' defining gameplay elements have been carried over and as before, Snake must use stealth and wits rather than brute force to infiltrate enemy zones and eliminate his major adversaries. Unlike the previous games, this installment takes place in a large outdoor jungle. Snake is able to use camouflage, climb trees, hide in tall grass or wear clothes that make him less noticeable.",

        "summary": "10,000 Bullets is an action/third-person shooter in which the gun-wielding player character battles numerous enemies and bosses in different environments. Styled similar to cinematography found in The Wachowskis' The Matrix film franchise and gameplay mechanics in games such as Dead to Rights and Max Payne, the player is given an ability to slow down time and thus dodge multitudes of flying bullets and other obstacles. The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities. Between the action sequences, the player must advance the plot through a graphic adventure-style interface, where certain characters must be spoken to in order to continue.",

You play as a demon-fighting special forces team member who must protect people from Kyonshi attack as you attempt to evacuate a building. Use swords, guns, and even barriers made of rice to weaken the Kyonshis, then stab them with your lucky charm. The people you're trying to protect all have unique traits, some being slow, others being weak, and you'll have to study their data in order to properly guide them to safety. You can send commands to the people you're guiding, telling them when to stop and when to play dead (this latter act makes the Kyonshis stop their attack).",

Ships and abilities unlocked in Episode Mode can be used here. \n \nEpisode Mode - Players go through missions from the five shows (starting with Enterprise and finishing with Voyager), collecting new ships, and character cards of each generation's command crew, which upgrades their respective ship's capabilities. \n \nMulitiplayer Mode - Players go head to head in combat campaigns to see who can survive the longest in battle. \n \nThe full arsenal of Trek weapons and abilities can be used for each ship, including phasers, photon/quantum torpedoes, shields, scanners, mines, tractor beams, and transporters.",

Defeating enemies yields EXP, and at the end of each stage, the player can either use that EXP to level up, increasing Vincent's stats, or convert it to Gil (the in-game currency), which can then be used to purchase items and equipment upgrades.",

With nowhere to go, Mike appears to be doomed until he is suddenly teleported into the sky in another dimension, and must defend himself against an army of flying Prehistoric predators.", 
        "summary": "Dino Stalker is a horror light gun shooter video game developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2. It is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.",

        "storyline": "In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..", 
        "summary": "Take control of a fully armed prototype mechanized robot and fight off enemies during a space colony hijack in Hideo Kojima's Zone of the Enders. In it, players become the character Leo Stenbuck, who sees the consequences of fighting first hand as he learns the true meaning of life and death. Combining state of the art PlayStation 2 graphics, tons of weapons, and an involving storyline, Zone of the Enders also provides a dynamically changing mission structure, a versus mode for two players, and a playable demo of Metal Gear Solid 2: Snake Eater in all first-run production copies.",

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (SD) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface. This makes it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces.\n\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast, the few social elite born commanders and some trained troopers, they all require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to the planet Helghan's atmosphere for long term period away from the planet. Unprepared, outnumbered and outgunned, Vekta's only hope rests with an elite squad of four soldiers who will turn the tide of the war.\n\nAs the climactic war razes across Vekta, Templar allies himself with troops on the outskirts of Vekta City, desperately repelling endless waves of besieging assaults from the imperious Helghast forces, but are eventually driven into a defensive retreat.",

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.\n\nThis is the very rare steelbook of Killzone Collector's Editon. It's one of few games that exist for the PS2 that come with a steelbook, bonus DVD, and was limited to 250 copies per region.",

But two ninja (named Guren and Gunjo) have arrived as humanity's last hope. Together they travel the demon-infested country to find Kigai, stop him from sacrificing Princess Koto, and save her at all costs. And thus a new war had spawned, humanity versus the demon race.",

Two years later it was also published as a PlayStation 2 exclusive title with GunCon 2 compatibility.\n\nNinja Assault was developed by Namco, who also created the Time Crisis series. However, this game has more in common with Lethal Enforcers, Virtua Cop, and The House of the Dead series, whereby the movement is completely \"on-rails\" (i.e., with no hiding pedal), and the player must shoot away from the screen to reload. Both versions of this game support up to two players in cooperative gameplay.",

The player takes the role of an EDF (Earth Defence Force) infantry man to single handily battle hordes of giant bugs, robots and alien ships that have invaded Earth, across 30 missions. The game eludes to other EDF forces, but they are never seen.\n\nYou choose two weapons for each mission from dozens of various missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers and more unique weapons, some, faster, more powerful or better suited to the mission at hand than others, are given infinite ammo (though the weapons must still be reloaded after each clip is used up) and are set loose in one of several (usually city-based) fully destructible environments. Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air bike, a tank and a helicopter.\n\nThe player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen. The game also features 2-player split-screen cooperative multiplayer.",

In the Oceans are floating harbors where supplies like fuel and ammo can be bought to hunt down the monster. Here the player can also buy better guns and upgrade his ship. At the harbor the player can also take on missions. Missions usually involve sailing to a certain area and gunning down enemies from the deck of your ship.

Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers.

        "storyline": "The game begins with Vetch (voiced by Steve Tarlow) receiving a transmission from his lieutenant, Overlord (Jason Gregory), who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice. Rather than kill Haven, Vetch decides to watch him, hoping to turn the situation to his own advantage. Meanwhile, in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra, Haven (Jake Rosewall-Gallagher) is completing his latest invention; a mechanical bird named Talon. Upon finishing, Haven heads to work in the mines. However, upon entering, he sees his friend Chess (Regan Kerwan) being questioned by a guard. The guard tries to shoot Haven, but misses, and causes the mine to collapse, knocking out Haven.\n\nHe awakens under the treatment of Dr. Spong (Andrew Silber), who tells him Chess hasn't been seen since the collapse. Setting out to find her, he eventually reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who contacts Vetch to tell him Haven has infiltrated the castle, as they planned. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams. She refuses to tell him anything, and Haven intervenes, killing Overlord and freeing Chess. They escape, and Chess says that while in detention, she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes. Haven decides he must speak to this slave.\n\nHaven heads to the Isle of Heroes, and meets the Wise Man (Terry Bertram). He tells him of his dreams of a golden bell on top of a mountain, and the Wise Man tells him the legend of Athellion and the Golden Voice; Vetch and Athellion were enemies for many years, and Vetch was determined to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, he was unable to even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, he left behind the Golden Bell, but Vetch bribed a council member named Dasis to infect the people of Aurias with a virus for which he controlled the only antidote. Making the people of Aurias his slaves, he sealed off the Mount of Sighs, on which resides the Golden Voice. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man tells Haven when Vetch first came to Aurias, the people hid many artifacts inside a volcano named Mount Firash, and speculates there may be something there which can point the way to the Mount.\n\nHaven heads to Firash and locates a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. However, as he escapes Firash, he is captured and placed in the Sylex, a space station prison. He flees in an escape pod and lands on Exarco, a planet populated by lizard-like humanoids. He soon meets brothers Chill (Dale Stump) and Will (Aubrey Hodges). They tell him they will give him a ship if he helps them protect their eggs from giant insectoid-like creatures. Haven does so, however, the insect queen attacks the local village. Haven defeats her, and Chill and Will present him with the ship Sunsurfer. He then heads to Auria.\n\nHe makes it to the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra and rescuing Chess. She tells him she was using a device she found in Overlord's castle to try to find the antidote refinery so as to free the slaves. Haven attaches the device to the Sunsurfer navigation computer and they head to the refinery on the planet Ferven.\n\nThey pump the antidote into a waiting transport ship, and the duo escape. However, Chess reveals she has been working with Vetch all along, who appears on the bridge and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.\n\nHaven escapes, but is unable to free Chess, and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone, promising to return for Chess. He returns to the Mount of Sighs, where he hears Vetch tell Athellion that he will kill Haven and Chess once Athellion is dead. He then kills Athellion. Haven confronts him, but Vetch defeats him. However, the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps Haven alive. As such, Vetch ties Haven to a rock, pointing out \"you can't live forever\" and leaves him alone on the planet. The game ends on this cliffhanger.", 
        "summary": "The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign. \n \nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. \n \nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.",

        "storyline": "The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghan Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Extrasolar War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer ISA colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (SD) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface. This makes it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces.\n\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast, the few social elite born commanders and some trained troopers, they all require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to the planet Helghan's atmosphere for long term period away from the planet. Unprepared, outnumbered and outgunned, Vekta's only hope rests with an elite squad of four soldiers who will turn the tide of the war.\n\nAs the climactic war razes across Vekta, Templar allies himself with troops on the outskirts of Vekta City, desperately repelling endless waves of besieging assaults from the imperious Helghast forces, but are eventually driven into a defensive retreat.", 
        "summary": "Set in the near future during a period of planetary colonization, Killzone drops you in the middle of a war between the ISA Command and a militaristic separatist faction, the Helghast. As one of four ISA members, your initial objective is to escort a high-ranking official to an evacuation point. You can experience several gameplay modes, including single-player, multiplayer (team-based and competitive), and online play for up to 12 players. Players can equip themselves with an armory of more than 27 different weapons based on modern technology.",

In order to survive in the harsh environment, these people mutated to the point of no longer remaining human. They developed a passionate hatred for mankind, and eventually formed the Helghast Empire, attacking the planet Vekta controlled by the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA). As Helghast soldiers invade the planet's perimeter, the ISA forces are trying to hold the ground and find a way to stop them.", 
        "summary": "Killzone is a sci-fi-themed first-person shooter. The game's stand-out feature is the ability to control any of the four different protagonists, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses. Up to sixteen players could compete in the online multiplayer portion, which includes eight maps and six modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Assault, Defend and Destroy, Supply Drop, and Domination. The online servers of the game have now been closed down.",

Bill Rizer, the hero of the Alien Wars, was held responsible for the incident, as well as for murdering his partner, Lance Bean, who reportedly tried to stop him. He was given a sentence of 10,000 years in cryogenic prison.\n\nHowever, five years later, in 2647, Earth faces another threat as the terrorist organization \"Blood Falcon\", led by a mysterious and superhuman commander, spreads panic over the world. The ruling government, referred to as the \"Triumvirate\", decides to release Bill Rizer prior to completing his sentence, in view of his previous successes in defending Earth, in hope of neutralizing Blood Falcon. Lucia, an advanced cyborg soldier built by the government from Dr. Geo Mandrake's research, is sent to accompany and assist Bill's endeavors. Bill eventually finds out that Lance is still alive and is in fact the commander of Blood Falcon himself.\n\nAfter defeating Lance, it is revealed that the aliens from the past games attacked because the Triumvirate secretly stole a mysterious, powerful \"Relic\" from them. With this information, Bill and Lucia have to confront Triumvirate and uncover the secret of the alien Relic.",

The battle between the Corporations has re-emerged and continues unabated. Now a new Corporation has entered the scene; this Corporation, Navis, while nowhere near the size of the other Corporations, does have a trump card; it has complete control over a brand new and very useful resource, and they do not intend to share. The other Corporations obviously will not sit back and let that stand, so they set up contracts with Ravens through Raven's Ark. Of course, Navis is employing the use of the Ravens as well, and a full-scale conflict seems apparent on the horizon. Once again, you are thrust into the lines of corporate warfare, but does something even more dangerous lie in wait? It is the sequel to Silent Line: Armored Core.",

Heading out with his senior partner Anna Steele, Lazarus sets off on what he believes is a routine call but, in the true spirit of survival horror, it's not long before the crime-bothering duo are knee-deep in ectoplasm. After much bickering between the pair, Jones somehow inadvertently sets free a horde of ghosts contained in the school's secret paranormal research lab. An errant apparition materialises, grabs Anna, and drags her away with him to a dark, eerie place (the school canteen, perhaps?). One of the wayward spooks (Astral) also manages to 'bond' with Jones, giving him the gift of supernatural sight, allowing him to see dead people. Nice. Picking up the reins as Laz, you'll start out in search of Anna, and attempt to figure out the mysteries buried deep in the school's past along the way...",

The Resident Evil 4: Premium Edition features a making-of DVD, as well as a RE artbook and an art cell of Ada Wong. \n \nThe fourth installment of Capcom's pivotal \"Survival Horror\" series continues on Nintendo GameCube and PS2. The title takes place in 2004 some six years after the events that transpired in Resident Evil 2. The government has destroyed the Umbrella Corporation, which has been behind just about every plot and disgusting bio-chemical mutation in the survival horror series. Now-US agent Leon Kennedy (of Resident Evil 2 fame) has been dispatched to Europe to save the President's daughter from \"crazed organizations.\" RE4 boasts some of the most impressive visuals to date on Nintendo's next generation console, and takes the series into the realm of truly three-dimensional gameplay. Stagnant environments found in previous Resident Evil games are replaced by detailed 3D surroundings complete with dynamic camera work.",

Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases.\n\nThe player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.",

Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious.\nHowever, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again! Like other games in the R-Type Series, the game is a scrolling shooter where you need to guide a spaceship through various stages and destroy the many enemies (including very large end of level bosses).\nThe game features a large variety of spaceships (over 100!) to choose from, each with varying capabilities. Regardless of which ship you choose, you begin the game with limited firepower; you can fire a basic weapon, or hold down a button to charge up and fire a more powerful burst. Occasionally power ups will appear on the screen; collect these to equip your ship with additional weapons, including a variety of lasers, missiles, and other useful items. In addition to the normal game, an AI VS mode is also included. In this mode, you can set up one of your available fighters to be controlled by the computer and then fight it to see who wins in various battles.",
