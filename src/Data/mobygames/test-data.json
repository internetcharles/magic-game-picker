        "description": "007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...\n\nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.",

On 31st March 31 2003, a hacker called Habibi-Xbox used a buffer overflow in the game and became the first to hack into an unmodified Xbox. This was part of a $100,000 challenge funded by Lindows founder Michael Robertson.\n\nJames Bond\n\nThe game's James Bond is a combination of elements from all five previous Bonds.\n\nPre-release version\n\nThe pre-lease version of 007 : Agent Under Fire contained multiple elements not present in the final game. Major elements include Bond wearing a tuxedo, John Cleese as R, GoldenEye-style health bars, different weapon and death animations, a silver BMW 750iL, blood and gore effects, more detailed explosions and the Q-Claw being a wrist gadget rather than a mobile phone. Rumored legal issues with EoN Productions (producers of the Bond movies) led to John Cleese not being present in the final game, and concerns over a potentially alienating Mature rating from the ESRB and the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks led to the violence being toned down.\n\nMuch of the pre-release footage was initially found on a bonus disc accompanied with PlayStation World magazine from August 2001 prior to release, but is now on YouTube.\n\nAdditional information contributed by MegaMegaMan.\n\n More"

        "description": "You take on the role of James Bond and must save the world. The Phoenix International Corporation is focused on dismantling nuclear warheads throughout the world, but later evidence has been found that the CEO of the corporation, Raphael Drake, is using his company's concept as a means to find and use the warheads for his own purposes. Because his plans are so well hidden, it is up to Bond, with the help of Q and his gadgets, to stop Drake at whatever cost.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be taken to more than ten exotic areas, reaching all areas of the globe, confronting the beautiful Bond women. In your quest to stop the Phoenix Corporation, you have a variety of weapons available to you, from your trusty Walther to more advanced and prototype machinery.\n\nThere are twelve total missions, all of which combine stealth, combat, and Q's trusty gadgets, such as your laser watch and X-ray eyeglasses.'\n\nThere are five levels that take place in your Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, and other exotic but deadly sports cars. These missions aren't available in the computer version of the game, instead the Windows version has some other bonus missions.\n\nOn the multiplayer side of things, there are over ten multiplayer modes, some of which include characters and settings from previous Bond moves.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nDevelopment\n\nAfter work was finished on 007: The World is Not Enough, Electronic Arts decided to unlink the games from the films since it was very hard to get the game finished simultaneously with the film. They wanted Eurocom Entertainment Software to make a game based on one of the old movies, but updated as in a remake. Keeping the original 60s setting was brought up several times, but always rejected.\n\nAfter going through the movies, the decision fell on the Bond film You Only Live Twice, but EA preferred Moonraker. Eventually the remake idea was dropped and Nightfire being something of a mash-up of both films. For example, Raphael Drake, the game's villain, closely resembles Moonraker's Hugo Drax. Moonraker also featured narrow escapes from shuttle exhaust, villains fleeing into space and a laser battle on an orbital platform.\n\nGuns\n\nWith the exception of some of the more far-out guns (such as the laser rifle), most of the guns in this game are real world weapons (in fact many of them also featured in Counter-Strike). However, to avoid royalty issues with the gun manufacturers, the game gives them all slightly altered names. For example, Bond's famous Walther PPK has now become the Wolfram PP7, and the Fn PN90 from Counter-Strike and Stargate SG-1 has become the Munitions Belga PDW90.\n\nReferences\n\nThe ending credits feature the famous cinematic phrase, \"James Bond Will Return.\"\n\nAdditional information contributed by Sciere and Terrence Bosky\n\n More"

The stadium is big and impressive and full of colored crowd.\n\nAs in FIFA Soccer 2002, the animation was taken from real players, with motion sensors. Thus, some new animation was added - new sliding, falling, and more.\n\nAnd the newest feature of 2002 FIFA World Cup, is the air ball control model. You can take balls from the air, and have much more control with them - creating great goals from the air.",
