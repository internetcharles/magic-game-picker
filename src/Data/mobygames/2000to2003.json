        "description": "007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure...\n\nThe game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.",

On 31st March 31 2003, a hacker called Habibi-Xbox used a buffer overflow in the game and became the first to hack into an unmodified Xbox. This was part of a $100,000 challenge funded by Lindows founder Michael Robertson.\n\nJames Bond\n\nThe game's James Bond is a combination of elements from all five previous Bonds.\n\nPre-release version\n\nThe pre-lease version of 007 : Agent Under Fire contained multiple elements not present in the final game. Major elements include Bond wearing a tuxedo, John Cleese as R, GoldenEye-style health bars, different weapon and death animations, a silver BMW 750iL, blood and gore effects, more detailed explosions and the Q-Claw being a wrist gadget rather than a mobile phone. Rumored legal issues with EoN Productions (producers of the Bond movies) led to John Cleese not being present in the final game, and concerns over a potentially alienating Mature rating from the ESRB and the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks led to the violence being toned down.\n\nMuch of the pre-release footage was initially found on a bonus disc accompanied with PlayStation World magazine from August 2001 prior to release, but is now on YouTube.\n\nAdditional information contributed by MegaMegaMan.\n\n More"

The Phoenix International Corporation is focused on dismantling nuclear warheads throughout the world, but later evidence has been found that the CEO of the corporation, Raphael Drake, is using his company's concept as a means to find and use the warheads for his own purposes. Because his plans are so well hidden, it is up to Bond, with the help of Q and his gadgets, to stop Drake at whatever cost.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be taken to more than ten exotic areas, reaching all areas of the globe, confronting the beautiful Bond women. In your quest to stop the Phoenix Corporation, you have a variety of weapons available to you, from your trusty Walther to more advanced and prototype machinery.\n\nThere are twelve total missions, all of which combine stealth, combat, and Q's trusty gadgets, such as your laser watch and X-ray eyeglasses.'\n\nThere are five levels that take place in your Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, and other exotic but deadly sports cars. These missions aren't available in the computer version of the game, instead the Windows version has some other bonus missions.\n\nOn the multiplayer side of things, there are over ten multiplayer modes, some of which include characters and settings from previous Bond moves.",

They wanted Eurocom Entertainment Software to make a game based on one of the old movies, but updated as in a remake. Keeping the original 60s setting was brought up several times, but always rejected.\n\nAfter going through the movies, the decision fell on the Bond film You Only Live Twice, but EA preferred Moonraker. Eventually the remake idea was dropped and Nightfire being something of a mash-up of both films. For example, Raphael Drake, the game's villain, closely resembles Moonraker's Hugo Drax. Moonraker also featured narrow escapes from shuttle exhaust, villains fleeing into space and a laser battle on an orbital platform.\n\nGuns\n\nWith the exception of some of the more far-out guns (such as the laser rifle), most of the guns in this game are real world weapons (in fact many of them also featured in Counter-Strike). However, to avoid royalty issues with the gun manufacturers, the game gives them all slightly altered names. For example, Bond's famous Walther PPK has now become the Wolfram PP7, and the Fn PN90 from Counter-Strike and Stargate SG-1 has become the Munitions Belga PDW90.\n\nReferences\n\nThe ending credits feature the famous cinematic phrase, \"James Bond Will Return.\"\n\nAdditional information contributed by Sciere and Terrence Bosky\n\n More"

There is now an increased social element, with people appearing to use train stations in-game. A new materials system introduces complexity by introducing the concept of scarcity, with the presence of different materials necessary for industries to be built up around train stations.\n\nThe PS2 and Windows versions are essentially identical aside from control schemes. The PS2 version includes the option to install the game to the PS2 hard drive, while the Windows version always runs from the hard drive. Both versions featured optional, paid expansion packs, but they contain different content; the Windows version's are more complex and featured additional content.",

        "description": "Rouge Victoire is the spunky young princess of Silverbell Kingdom. As the heiress of the royal family, an incredible power lies within her... a power that she is not always able to fully control. Shion Earthland, Rouge's childhood friend, is a young swordsman sworn as her protector. With the king, Rouge's father, in failing health, and the queen turned to stone by a terrible curse, Rouge must prove herself fit to rule her country and learn to control her power with the help of her friends and her indomitable sense of justice.\n\nAbarenb\u014d Princess (\"Rowdy Princess\") is a basic Japanese-style RPG broken into eight chapters, with the player controlling a party of up to four characters at any one time. However, rather than earning experience and leveling up, each character's effectiveness in battle is determined by their \"motivation\". Depending on the player's responses during story events, characters' motivation levels will change. A character with higher motivation will perform better in battle, and have more skills available for use. A given response may cause one characters' motivation to increase, but also cause others' to decrease, so it is important to balance all of the relations to ensure an effective party.\n\nDuring battle, the player is not given direct command over their party members, but rather selects from a list of orders to give, such as \"Attack that lizard!\", \"Save your energy!\", or \"Leave it to me!\" Depending on that character's motivation, certain options may be unavailable or ineffective. Similarly, the player may also see a list of possible moves that each enemy may make that turn. Although the player technically controls Shion, the game will only be over if Rouge loses all her HP. However, if a battle is lost, the player may choose to simply retry the battle immediately. Winning a battle also allows Shion to comment on what happened, which will also affect motivation levels.\n\nIndividual chapters can be replayed once completed, and the best times and scores are saved. There is also a training mode, where the player can test out various attacks and battle setups without fear of a game over.",

The neighboring Erusea used this as an opportunity to invade and occupy almost all of Usea. Based on its eastern coast, the Independent States Allied Forces (ISAF) try to regain ground and engage the Eruseans in aerial battles. An elite pilot using the codename Mobius 1 is sent on a number of missions to fight Eruseans and help ISAF to win the war. While performing those missions, Mobius 1 begins to learn about the impact war has on civilians, and the pilots of the opposing side.\n\nAce Combat 04: Shattered Skies is an aerial combat simulation. It allows the player to participate in semi-realistic dog-fighting with a collection of fighter jets, including the F-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-117 Nighthawk, U-2 Dragon Lady, C-130 Hercules and SR-71 Blackbird. Eighteen missions will take the player from search-and-destroy buildings to one-on-one and all-on-all dog-fighting.

Therefore was a retail distribution of the compilation in Germany out of the question (a side effect of the indexing).\n\nSo, the only solution was for Activision to file an application for verification of that particularly title at the BPjS. And since the reason for the index was out of date (assuming it was up do date in 1984 at all - see River Raid trivia), the game was de-indexed on January 2003.\n\nBut the really interesting fact here is that without the application, the Activision Anthology would be adult only in Germany. And now, after the de-indexing of River Raid and a normal rating with the USK (the German age rating organization) for this compilation here, the Activision Anthology is available without restrictions in Germany.\n\nOnline Feature\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of this game was originally going to have an online feature that would have let you downloaded new games into Activision Anthology.

        "description": "In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available: Quick game (a simple game where the players sets all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot.\n\nGameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again. Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a \"behind the player\" camera. Unlike other games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on the bottom court.",

Some things that were cut out of the final game are...\n\nA fifth resource: ore. Was removed because it made the game too complex.\n\nOutlaw units. These were intended to function like wolves, guys that belong to no player and attack you if you get near. Were removed because they were too annoying.\n\nSea walls. These were supposed to be built by ships and could withstand a good amount of damage. I'm not sure why they weren't included.\n\nDolphins: you were supposed to be able to fish these like any other sort of fish. Microsoft forced Ensemble to remove them!\n\nThe interesting thing is, all of those things and more are still hidden in the game, buried inside the .dat file. If you reverse-engineer the game, you are able to access them, and add them to custom scenarios. Templates have been released that contain all of them.\n\nDry Dock Technology\n\nDry dock technology decreases the amount of gold a trade cog brings back home. The reduction can be at least 33% in some cases.\n\nIt seems to be balanced with the ship speed increase so that the productivity of trade cogs remains about the same as before dry dock research. In some cases I had slightly better gold income (gold/second) before the research of dry docks than after. I did not make a thorough testing with many different distances, but what I did was test it in a deathmatch game too, to be sure it does happen in real games.\n\nSource - From a post by SimMayor realsimmayor@geocities.com on the AoE2.com forum\n\nhttp://www.coolboard.com/frame.cfm/mb=902460962910918\n\nEULA\n\nThe EULA of this game includes a clause which prohibits the use of Age of Empires II in a nuclear plant.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe MSN Gaming Zone is notoriously easy to hack, and cheaters are rife in Age of Kings games. A programmer named Tormentium released an unofficial patch for AoK (1.0E), which is supposed to make the game harder to hack. Too bad it doesn't work.\n\nPre-release\n\nBefore release, multiple pre-release versions were released on internet Warez sites. According to Matt Pritchard, they usually were only one or two weeks older than the latest in-house versions. It seems they came from various sources, including press previews, Microsoft test versions and even from Ensemble employees. They were also multiple attempts of hacking Ensemble's server and network.\n\nOn a lighter note, the German magazine GameStar bribed one of the official webmasters with \"German beer\" for some exclusive screenshots.\n\nReferences\n\nThis occurs during the Saladin Single Player campaign, during the mission in which you secure Jerusalem. If you strike down the Knights Templar leader (a hero unit), he declares, \"If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine!\" This is obviously a reference to Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Vader in Star Wars: A New Hope.\n\nSales\n\nBetween 1999 and 2000, Age of Empires II (PC) won a single Gold- and three Platinum-Awards from the German VUD (Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland - Entertainment Software Association Germany) for selling more then 100,000 units (Gold) and more then three times 200,000 units (Platinum) in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. As the Gold-Award is not counted into the Platinum-Award, all four awards total in between 700,000 and 1,700,000 units sold.\n\nAwards\nComputer Gaming World\nMarch 2000 (Issue #188) \u2013 Best Weapon of the Year (for the Trebuchet)\nMarch 2000 (Issue #188) \u2013 Best Interface Design of the Year\nGameSpy\n2001 \u2013 #16 Top Game of All Time\nGameStar (Germany)\n1999 - Best Game (Editors' Vote)\n1999 - Best Game (Readers' Vote)\nPC Gamer\n1999 - Real-Time Strategy Game of the Year\nPC Player (Germany)\nIssue 01/2000 - Best Real-Time Strategy Game in 1999\nVerband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (Entertainment Software Association Germany)\n1999/2000 - Gold Award for selling more then 100,000 units in Germany, Austria and Switzerland\n1999/2000 - Three Platinum Awards for selling more then 200,000 units in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Every award is counted individually\n\nInformation also contributed by Heikki Sairanen, Ingold, jeremy strope, Maw and Xoleras\n\n More"

        "description": "Combine the many tricks and styles of the extreme sport, inline skating, with a Tony Hawk style system, complete with objectives and huge arenas, and you have Aggressive Inline.\n\nProgress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once you are bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called \"juice meter\": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game, you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a \"learning by doing\" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level that open up new areas within the level.\n\n10 pro inline skaters join the fun (Shane Yost, Sam Fogarty, Sven Boekhorst, Eito Yasuko and more), and you can take on a friend in 2 player split screen.",

The gameplay is simple and traditional: you read the text, watch the scenes that unfold in front of you, and take decisions during conversations, that will determine the character of your relationships with the girls and the outcome of the story.\n\nIn the game, you play as three different characters through three different scenarios. The first one is the Dream Scenario. You play as Yukito, a travelling entertainer. You carry around a doll and move it by using your \"magic\". When you were young, your mother told you a story about a mysterious girl who lives on the opposite side of the sky. Now you travel constantly, trying to find this girl of your dreams. You meet three girls, Misuzu, Kano, and Minagi, and depending on your actions, will have different relationships with them. Once you finish the Dream Scenario, you unlock the Summer Scenario, which is set in 994 AD and in which you play as a nobleman Ry\u016bya. The last one is the Air Scenario, in which you'll play as Misuzu's pet crow, and see the events of the first scenario from the crow's perspective.\n\nAir was originally released for PC as an adult game with erotic scenes. There is also an \"all ages\" version for PC, and the console ports also don't have erotic content. The PC versions do not contain voice acting as the console ports do.",

        "description": "Air Ranger Rescue is a single player game in which the player pilots a rescue helicopter.\n\nThere are three helicopters to fly in this game, the MBB/Kawasaki BK-117-B, the Boeing CH-47J \"Chinook \", and the Hughes/Kawasaki OH-6D. The game consists of eight timed missions each of which has three levels of difficulty, plus in the training section there's also a 'Free Flight' mode. The first missions are flown in the small OH-6D, missions two and above together with the other craft being locked off until the preceding missions have been completed successfully.\nMissions are scored on a points system, victims must be rescued while in good health so points are lost if they are not picked up in good time and, of course, points are deducted should the helicopter hit a building or should a victim die.\n\nThe training section is in the form of a manual and it not only explains the game's controls but also the workings of the helicopter and includes sections of video footage.",

While taking a stroll, a woman's scream is heard... you run to see what is happening, and the mystery begins. You can select main character to be a man or a woman, which slightly influences the game scenario (when the player is a man, his partner will be a woman and vice-versa).\n\nGame progress advances as a mystery novel. As the case becomes obvious you will investigate and use deductive skills to find out the culprit and the motive behind the crime. During the gameplay you can visit various places and check the map of the Bell Garden school and its surroundings. During investigation and story progress, you will use a character correlation diagram to connect a certain person with the matter at hand. Also, the diagram can be used to make relations between characters (for example to mark them as lovers). Story can have more endings, depending on the player's deduction and skills to solve the case. After a solved case, if available, a new scenario will open.",

The focus of the game is the story mode during which the player visits four stages (Neo-Tokyo, Laboratory, A-Room and Olympic Stadium) which are also divided into different tables. On each table, the player has to reach special objectives with the usual pinball mechanics, e.g. hitting certain things in the correct order. There are also optional secret rooms to find. After finishing all objectives, the next table is unlocked as well as a cutscene directly taken from the movie.\n\nThe arcade mode is unlocked after finishing the story and allows the player to freely play the tables for highscores. The vs. mode (either against the AI or another human) is played on two tables which are divided in the middle, but are interconnected through a loop at the top. The main goal is to send as many balls as possible to the opponent's side because each lost ball gives a penalty point. The first player to reach a certain number loses the match.",

Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion's league, or defending the club's reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well.\n\nThe actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team. The French version portrays manager Guy Roux (famous of Auxerre), while the UK version has Alex Ferguson (Manchester United).",

But you're not going alone... your companion will be a redhead by the name of Aline Cedrac who has her own reasons for tagging along. Aside from being a woman and inexperienced in the world of danger, she is the only one with the knowledge for translating the ancient Abkhani tabloids which may hold the secrets behind Carnby's friend's death and the disappearance of Aline's father.\n\nUpon arriving on the island, your plane has been shot down by the things unknown, and the heroes have no other choice but to jump with a parachute, thus separating them on the island.\n\nNow you choose the character to play with, either as Edward Carnby or Aline Cedrac, as they explore the mysterious and gloomy island with all its secrets and parallel stories that contain different locations and tasks for different characters, thus adding the level of replayability in a different experience - Carnby's story is more action oriented while Cedrac has more puzzles to solve.\n\nJust like in the predecessors you move your characters through pre-rendered backgrounds while the camera perspective switches around. You collect various items and books which are used to solve puzzles. Many situations can only be solved with violence which means you'll have to use guns to get rid of your foes. Aiming is manual and especially when playing Cedrac ammo is scarce. Saving a game uses up a save medallion which can be found during the game.",

It is based on the arcade Alpine Racer series played on a cabinet where the player stands on a set of ski-like foot stands that are moved with horizontal motions to steer and taking corners while holding onto two bars for stability. This is the first game in the series made for a console system. The features and game modes are most likely not identical to the Alpine Racer 3 arcade game. A first for the series, it mixed skiing with snowboarding previously featured in the arcade game Alpine Surfer.\n\nThe main game mode is the Extreme Winners Cup that features cross races, slalom, one-on-one and time attack. These largely serve to qualify for the tournaments. There are eight characters to choose from (one initially locked) and several courses. Each character has different statistics based on speed, turning and power. By winning races credits are earned to upgrade the snowboard and ski gear. Next to steering an additional button can be used to crouch and gain extra speed, but this limits movement. The same button is used in the air to perform tricks. The game can be played competitively against another player through a split-screen. Some of the equipment in the game comes from licensed manufacturers.",

It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevin has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance.\n\nLuckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevin gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevin's life energy, new moves or better weapons.\n\nBesides combat, the game features basic switch puzzles and rhythm-based mini games. Most notable is the Time Dilation Mode, which can be activated near enemies - then the mini game begins and, if successfully completed, launches an especially powerful attack.",

        "description": "American Idol is a rhythm game based on the reality TV singing competition of the same name.\n\nPlayers can create characters of either gender, choosing from several character templates, and then customizing them with body size, skin color, and one of three singing voices per gender.\n\nCreated characters can then be taken through the game's various modes. In the main Competition mode, players move through different stages patterned after the TV series, from auditions to shows with a live audience and hopefully the finals. Between performances, outfit, hair style and color and make up can be customized, since not only the singing but also the style will be judged.\n\nPlaying the actual game involves a target on the screen into which symbols move in from four directions. The correct button has to be pressed in rhythm with the music when the appropriate symbol reaches the center. Besides single presses there are also connected symbols where the button has to be held and released or two buttons have to be pressed at the same time. The game also supports dance mats as an alternate type of control. Each symbol hit or not hit is graded according to the timing. Missing or hitting symbols off-sync will lead to the vocal track becoming increasingly off-key and will make it much harder to get into the next round. Completing the different stages of the competition unlocks bonus costumes as well as sets that can be used in the game's other modes.\n\nBesides the Competition, there is the Rehearsal mode in which songs can be practiced without judges. The Jukebox mode allows simple playback of songs, while Karaoke mode allows players to actually sing along to songs. There is no scoring included, but it's possible for other players to judge the performance afterwards. Party mode enables up to four players to engage in a small competition, with players allowed to judge each other.\n\nVisually, the game employs a cel shading style in which singers and judges are rendered. The American version includes the likenesses and voices of the three original TV judges Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson. The UK version retains only Cowell and the German version features no original judges, their places being taken by generic characters. The game's soundtrack consists of around 40 licensed pop songs. Video clips from the respective regional versions of the TV program play between stages of the competition mode.",

        "description": "The world of Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is populated by two races: human and Deimos. The two races prefer to avoid contact with each other, but both depend on the Spirit Stones to sustain the balance in the world. Recently, the human army began sweeping across the lands, taking over countries. This army is going after the five great Spirit Stones. The Spirits, however, are determined to prevent this; to achieve their goal, they choose two heroes who would eventually be able to unite the two races in a battle for justice. One of them a is a human nobleman named Kharg, who hates the Deimos and is planning revenge; another is a Deimos slave named Darc, who dreams of uniting and commanding his race. Will the two heroes be able to put aside their differences and save the world?..\n\nArc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a \"regular\" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.",

At the start of each mission, the player can choose the helicopter model and its co-pilot, whose characteristics modify the behavior of the airship (for example, a specialist in guns will increase the accuracy of shots). The mission objectives vary: there are rescue missions, where the winch is used to collect a character or object, demolition missions, where something has to be destroyed, and escort missions, where something must be protected from enemy attacks.\n\nThe PlayStation version contains two additional missions.",

The mission is simple, kill the traitor and his forces before all-out chaos begins.\n\nFight in the trenches of real-world battle areas set in the plastic toy world, or fight in the trenches of backyard gardens, using gnomes, flowers, and garden hoses as extra defense against the enemy. And just when the Tan army falls back, the ant or cockroach army comes rolling in, with the wildlife getting their own back on you.\n\nThe familiar \"Red Alert\" style resource management system allows you to choose from a wide range of attack and defense options. Resources themselves come from siphoning plastic and electricity from discarded toys, batteries, and the like scattered around the battlefield. When you lose a building or soldier, melt it down to re-build a new building or soldier.",

The story of the game involves Asterix and Obelix returning to their village in Gaul, after a day of hunting. They come to find that all their fellow village people have been captured. Along with their capture is also the theft of their magic potion, a potion that gives them superhuman strength. Caesar has captured the Gauls and spread them out to the furthest corners of the Roman Empire. Asterix and Obelix must find and free their friends and get the potion before it reaches Caesar.\n\nThe gameplay consists of the ability to switch between Asterix and Obelix at different times, using each one's skills to your advantage. Through the adventure, you will unlock and gain powerful combos and attack moves to help you. This large adventure takes you through six different countries made up of 47 areas, totaling 40 plus levels. The gameplay is varied from battling hundreds of Romans at once to riding/racing sequences and puzzle-solving. The graphics have vibrant colors, picturesque backgrounds, exciting special effects, and humorous animations. The sound includes zany effects, a range of music from roman to Egyptian, and good-humored voice acting.",

Prophecies foretell of a savior of the land who can prove to be a champion and defeat Zaugg. Ten Barbarians, all with their own reasons to hate Zaugg, come forward, each willing to destroy the wizard and prove themselves the hero of prophecy.\n\nBarbarian is a 3D vs. fighting game in a fantasy setting, inspired in gameplay largely by the Power Stone series. The game features ten characters who battle it out in fully three-dimensional, multi-level arenas, including castles, sewers, shipwrecks, swamps, and caverns.\n\nTraining mode includes tutorials for all of the game's moves and a practice session against a live opponent. Versus mode allows players to set up any fight they want, including four-player battles. The game's main single-player mode is Quest mode. Players select one of the ten characters, each of which has their own storyline. The story includes fights against all the other characters in the game and also features mirror matches. In some of the fights, opponents bring some lesser minions with them for support. After a fight is won, players can select which opponent to take on next, allowing for different paths through the story. Also after a fight, players can update their characters, raising their attributes like life, strength, damage dealt or magic regeneration time, and also unlock special abilities like double jumps or a berserker mode.\n\nThe fighting system is based on two basic buttons, one for weak and quick, one for strong and slow attacks. Stringing button combinations together enables combos, which each character having their own set. Some combos unleash magical attacks, which require the magic bar to be filled. Landing combos successfully enables additional rune attacks. Blocking and counters are also possible. The game's levels feature many objects to pick up that can be used as throwing or melee weapons. Objects come in different weights and require a certain amount of strength to pick up.",

Batman must rise to the challenge, as Sin Tzu leaves his mark on the city.\n\nAlong with Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl, Batman must battle through various locations in Gotham City in search of the truth behind this new foe, while fighting off the threat from other well-known characters from the comic book series, Bane, Clayface and Scarecrow.\n\nBatman can use his full collection of weapons and gadgets to his advantage, including the Batarang and grappling hook. Plus there's plenty of martial arts moves to bust on the bad guys, and if it's too much to fight off, the 2 player co-op mode allows two characters to battle side-by-side.",

The rising sea has resulted in the amount habitable land to decrease dramatically. All that is left are island chains, making land the most valuable resource on the planet. The entire population must survive and compete over these islands.\n\nCurrently, there are two distinct civilizations on Allium, settled into an uneasy cease-fire. There are the scientifically advanced Forseti and the aggressive Muspell. The Forseti have recently developed the most advanced combat vehicle in existence, the Battle Engine Aquila. The Aquila is both a four-legged mechanized tank and a combat jet, it is capable of switching modes at will. Players take the role of Hawk Winter, a Forseti cargo loader operator who has been conscripted because of his piloting skills.\n\nBattle Engine Aquila is a mechanized shooter taking place in a larger battlefield. The player plays only a single, yet important, role in a larger war effort. A large part of the gameplay consists of supporting and being supported by the allied forces. Players will have to fight naval, air, and ground forces in both modes of their battle engine.",

        "description": "Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 Battlestar Galactica miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series. Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.\n\nMissions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica's war room. Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.\n\nPlayers control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full. Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.\n\nMissiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu. Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius. This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.\n\nThough it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica. The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.",

In each song, color-coded notes scroll from the top of the screen in time with the music, and the corresponding keys must be pressed at the correct time to play along with the music. Good timing will increase the player's Groove Level, while poor timing or missed notes will decrease it, and the goal is to have the Groove Level above a certain level at the end of the song.\n\nThere are three main modes in the game. Arcade mode is presents a selection of so-called \"courses\" which consist of five songs each, which must be cleared in order. Free mode allows any track played in Arcade mode to be freely replayed. Practice mode is exactly what it sounds like: a practice mode where songs or sections of songs can be practiced without any risk of failure. There are also a large number of unlockable songs and courses, and numerous modifiers that affect the note charts and displays.",

As usual for the beatmania series, the player is given seven piano keys and a turntable, and must play along with the notes that scroll down the screen to play the music.\n\nThere are three main modes: Arcade mode tasks the player with completing several tracks in succession, Free mode lets the player freely play any unlocked song, and Practice mode lets the player practice parts of songs without danger of failure. The Beginner's and Drill modes introduced in 5th style also return. This edition also introduces a gallery mode where illustrations and the in-game videos can be viewed.",

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increases. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.\n\nThe player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruits her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Besides hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved).",

Although you could probably make an argument \u2013 this game really has no connection to the German philosopher. As an action reporter, players need to investigate beyond the superficial facts of what is good and what is evil \u2013 which is dictated through government propaganda in the game. The player has to see what nobody else can see, what is hidden to the people of Hyllis. This theme is relevant to issues we face today \u2013 understanding the reasons behind the apparent facts.\n\nPromotional websites\n\nThe publishers registered the websites for both the iris network (www.irisnetwork.net) and the Hyllian gov. (www.hylliannews.com) both featuring promotional material and assorted stuff.\n\nSave games code\n\nAll the saved games in Beyond Good & Evil are marked with an \"Internet Code\". The purpose of this code is two-fold, first it enables you to go to the official website and check your ranking against all the other BG&E players in the world. Secondly, upon completion of the main game, you'll be able to use your saved game code on the official website and obtain instructions on how to go about obtaining missing MDisk #13 within the game.\n\nSoundtrack\nIn the Beginning\nDancing With Domz\nHome Sweet Home\nHyllian Suite\nMammago's Garage\nIsle de Noir\nMineshaft Madness\nSay Cheese, Fellas\nAkuda House Propaganda\nAncient Chinese Secrets\nDon't Fear the Reaper\nFear the Reaper\nFun and Mini-Games\nFunky Bar 100\nWhen Domz Attack\nSlaughterhouse Scramble\nSneaky Jade Suite\nOrganic Beauty\nViolent Jade Suite\nHeart of Darkness\nMetal Gear Domz\nSomething Completely Different\nBehind Enemy Lines\nFree Your Mind\nThoughtful Reflections\nEnfants Disparus\nAbove and Beyond\nUnacceptable Losses\nIn Hot Pursuit\nSins of the Father\nRedemption\n\nIn February 2004, Ubisoft released MP3s of Beyond Good & Evil soundtrack to NintendoInsider.com.

For me, the meaning of this title is that you are always in the middle of an internal and external conflict, based on our conception of good and evil. In this game and in our world, propaganda thinks in our place; tells us these are our enemies and these are our friends. When you go beyond the appearances, you discover your own truth. That\u2019s the theme of the game and marketing finally accepted this title, and just replaced the between by beyond, which fits better with the vast universe and story.\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Action-Adventure Game of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Best Console Direction of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Music of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Direction of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Biggest PC Surprise of the Year\nEGM\nFebruary 2006 (Issue #200) - #171 out of 200 of the \"Greatest Games of Their Time\"\nGameSpy\n2003 \u2013 #3 Game of the Year\n2003 \u2013 #2 GameCube Game of the Year\nPC Powerplay (Germany)\nIssue 06/2005 - #8 Likeable Secondary Character (for Pey'j)\n\nInformation also contributed by Big John WV, Mark Ennis, Sciere, Terrence Bosky, WildKard, WindowsKiller and Zovni\n\n More"

It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.\n\nRayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appears to slow down.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nGerman index\n\nOn November 29, 2003, the English version of BloodRayne was put on the infamous German index by the BPjM. More information about what this means can be found in the game group.\n\nNocturne\n\nBloodrayne contains many references and influences from Nocturne, the old 3rd person supernatural-themed action-adventure by Terminal Reality. The Daemites that possess humans and turn them into weird Evil Dead-esque ghoulies first appeared in Blair Witch, Volume I: Rustin Parr, an expansion pack of sorts to Nocturne. Castle Gaustadt, where the final chapter of the game takes place, was the setting of Nocturne's first chapter. Plus, the Yathgy stone you were searching for in Nocturne's first chapter is one of the artifacts the Nazis are searching for in Bloodrayne. Finally, Bloodrayne's original character design was heavily influenced by Svetlana, a half-vampire ally of yours in Nocturne. In fact, in the game's early beta screenshots, Bloodrayne bore a remarkable resemblane to Svetlana, from her leather catsuit right down to her haircut.\n\nOther tie-ins to Nocturne: * In Act 3, you'll occasionally fight some large, bat-like vampire creatures. These exact same enemies appear in Nocturne. * Also in Act 3, Count Voicu is mentioned (in the Windmill level). He was a short, bearded old man in Nocturne who turned out to be the leader of the vampires (not to be confused with his son, also known as Count Voicu, who was the end boss of Nocturne's Act 1). If you pay attention, you'll even see a statue of the elder Voicu in Act 3 (big bearded guy with spiky shoulder pads). * Finally, the Dark Man in Bloodrayne has the exact same voice as the Stranger from Nocturne, and they're both played by the same guy. It's unlikely they're the same character, though, since the timelines conflict.\n\nPlayboy\n\nRayne appeared topless in the Playboy issue of October 2004. The press release:\n\nIf you felt teased by her sexy Girls of Gaming cover, then this new feature art is going to blow your mind! Rayne is 100% topless and smokin' hot in the October issue of Playboy magazine. This is a first in videogame history and trust us when we say that Rayne does not disappoint. The magazine hits newsstands in early September so here's a great excuse to get a copy!\n\nRayne\n\nProduct manager Liz Buckley admitted that the female protagonist first had a militant, dark gothic look, she was a brunette with tight buns in her hair and a very severe body line. In the final version, BloodRayne received a complete makeover to make her resonate with the target audience of males aged 17 to 34.\n\nReferences\n\nBreak open the right crate in the Nazi fortress and you'll find the Ark of the Covenant. How it got to Argentina in 1938 is anybody's guess.\n\nSwastikas\n\nIn all PC releases and the PAL Xbox version most swastikas were removed or replaced with triskelions.\n\nInformation also contributed by Alan Chan, Sciere and Xoleras\n\n More"

The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called \"DNA points,\" which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.",

        "description": "Slightly unusual for a tricks/stunt game, BMX XXX adds a twist to its genre by employing themes involving foul language, nudity, and toilet humor.\n\nThe \"Hardcore Tour\" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an ice cream man or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also, have to watch out for a health bar that accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.\n\nDo well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well...\n\nThere's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two-player split-screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.",

One feature that was removed in the censored version is the option of creating a naked female rider.\n\nMeanwhile, the kiwis decided to make a joke of Australia's censorship system by adding a \"BANNED IN AUSTRALIA\" sticker somewhere on the box.\n\nDave Mirra\n\nIn 2003, Dave Mirra launched a lawsuit against Acclaim over this game, claiming they had used the \"Dave Mirra brand\" in it's promotions and advertising. The lawsuit was settled amicably out of court.\n\nIndeed, Dave Mirra had appeared as a character in very early information for this game, prior to it's release.\n\nPark editor\n\nA park editor feature was announced in very early information, but was apparently scrapped. However, if one enters the cheat code BULLETPOINT, the feature pops up in the main game menu. Selecting any option in the editor menu will cause the game to freeze.\n\nPlayStation 2 version\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version has most of the actual photos of topless women censored, though polygonal nudity remains. Sony claimed:\n\nWe didn't feel that the topless nudity fundamentally added to the gameplay experience, and it presented in issue with regard to our global platform strategy and our guidelines. And because we have invested so much, and have built in so much equity to our system, we feel we need to protect that.\n\nUnused music tracks\n\nThe Xbox version has code for 8 music tracks that didn't appear in the final game. In the file music.zsd, there are tracks from rock and metal bands Motley Crue, No Doubt and The White Stripes, and rap groups Eric B. & Rakim and Quarashi.\n\nInformation also contributed by WildKard, Zack Green.\n\n More"

The nine-year-old city boy Boku once again spends his summer vacation in the countryside in 1975. It is a alternate universe sequel where the character spends his vacation with his family in a different location, but still meets many characters from the first game. The sequel is set in a Japanese southern coastal town on the tropical Izu Peninsula where his aunt and uncle have a bed and breakfast.\n\nThe game consists of fixed screen, pre-rendered environments with 3D models and a cinematic camera with a different viewpoint for each scene. Boku's vacation only lasts 31 days, but the player is free to choose how to spend his time as it is presented as a sandbox environment. It is possible to seek quests and help the people in town to solve their problems, but he can also choose to ride his bike anywhere, go bughunting, spend time fishing, dive into the ocean, launch a rocket, go on walk, play hide and seek, or play a mini-game of beetle wrestling. Many scenes offer interaction for the sake of exploration, with no further purpose. Time advances when a new scene is entered, so it is not possible to complete all content in a single playthrough.",

After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you're on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game.\n\nThere are several modes of play in Bombastic - Trial Mode, where you try to clear 100 levels; Story Mode, where you progress through stages trying to solve preset puzzles and fight bosses, and Battle Mode, where you fight against four opponents and try to stay alive as long as you can. In addition to the standard Bombastic mode, you can also unlock classic Devil Dice mode, where the dice sink into the ground instead of exploding.",

In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure.\n\nJetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature that keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action.\n\nThere are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.",

        "description": "The world is called Deep Earth. The world is a huge underground complex of cities and labyrinths. The world is populated by people who have never seen the sky and the sun in their lives. The world is dark and hostile, and knows no mercy. Technology is well developed in this world, but the society is ruled by a cruel law, dividing all the citizens into classes, depending on the their D-ratio - a form of identifying people and assigning to them a social status at the same time. This is the reality of mankind somewhere in a fantasy universe, which the hero Ryu is thrown into.\n\nRyu is a simple guard, a ranger with a low D-ratio - his job is to help to protect the citizens from genics - artificial monsters who have gone wild. During one such routine patrol Ryu runs into a mysterious silent girl named Nina, and saves her from a monster. Willing to protect her, Ryu discovers in himself a devastating power. He is now determined to do something for the people of Deep Earth, and perhaps even guide them to the surface of the planet.\n\nBreath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles.\n\nThe game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.",

The first two games (The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror) delved into the Knights Templar and Mayan mythology. This time, George Stobbart and Nico Collard are after the Voynich Manuscript to unravel its mysteries.\n\nThe Sleeping Dragon moves away from the 2D point-and-click concept from the earlier games and features a full 3D world, with a camera that does not rotate, but uses fixed cinematic perspectives, combined with full 5.1 sound. For the Windows version the game is no longer controlled through the mouse, but now through the keyboard, for the movement of the characters as well as all the actions. The player alternately controls George or Nico. Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas.\n\nThe locations visited throughout the game include The Congo, Paris, England, Czech Republic and Egypt.",

        "description": "Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real-life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions.\n\nBurnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games that focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas and implemented the racecourses throughout the streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost \"burnout\" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks, and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!\n\nBurnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign. While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints. You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.\n\nAlong with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play. Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race. Or you can reverse that with a friend. You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you. Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible. The bigger the crash, the better. Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.\n\nTraining and 2 player racing modes are also included.",

        "description": "Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is the prequel to all Castlevania games previously released, explaining the connection and never-ending war between the Belmont family and Dracula.\n\nYou play Leon Belmont, who was once a Baron for the King. After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way.\n\nThe gameplay mixes a style of hack-and-slash with a sense of strategy. In order to gain new abilities, you must first master the previous ones. This also includes relics and orbs, which will greatly help you in your quest to rescue Sara. Relics allow you to do special abilities necessary to solving certain puzzles, while orbs combine with power-ups you pick up and can create massive offensive or defensive power. The game contains many secrets, including five hidden bosses, who yield rewards (whip power-ups, orbs, relics, etc.) to the player upon defeat.",

The protagonist of the game is a Knight of the Dark Glyphs named Sieg Wahrheit. His best friend, Victor Delacroix, blames him for the death of Siela, Victor's sister and Sieg's lover. Unable to contain his despair, Victor decides to \"purify\" the sins of the world by unleashing hordes of monsters and finding three sacred glyphs to resurrect the evil spirit Azrail, who would eventually obliterate all existence.\n\nChaos Legion is an action game with a heavy emphasis on melee combat. The game's stand-out feature is Sieg's ability to summon the so-called Chaos Legions. Named after various emotions (Guilt, Hatred, Malice, etc.), these Legions have different combat styles, strengths, and weaknesses. Sieg himself is weakened once a Legion is being summoned, and has to rely on their powers to survive. The legions can be assigned general combat tactics, but are otherwise controlled by the AI. They can be upgraded during the course of the game, increasing their attack power, duration of their presence, etc.",

        "description": "The iteration of the Chessmaster series on the PlayStation 2 contains most of the features available in the corresponding PC game - which, in this case, is Chessmaster 9000. You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the \"build the picture\" type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games.\n\nThere are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the \"living world\" of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.",

        "description": "Ch\u014d Jik\u016b Y\u014dsai Macross for PlayStation 2 is an arcade flight/shooting game based on the Macross anime franchise. It allows players to play through the events of both the original 1982 TV series as well as the 1984 theatrical film Do You Remember Love? in two distinct campaigns.\n\nThe TV campaign consists of 12 missions while the movie campaign has only 8, but with a higher difficulty. The levels follow the original events closely, allowing the player to experience them from the point of view of a Valkyrie pilot of Skull Squadron. In addition to many of the TV characters making an appearance via voice communication, the game introduces new characters in the player's wing mates Eddie Juutilainen and Bruce Rudel and their tactical officer liaison on the Macross, Emma Granger.\n\nThe mission goals vary from \"destroy all enemies\" to defend and escort missions, and often change mid-mission. The action is seen from a third-person perspective behind the player's Valkyrie. Like in the anime, the Valkyrie can change from the default Fighter mode to Gerwalk and Battroid modes. All three differ greatly in control and armament and have unique control schemes. In Fighter and Gerwalk modes, targeted missiles can be used to lock on to the numerous enemies, with the Valkyrie armed with hundreds of light but only a few heavy missiles at the start of a mission. A standard gun is also available, but it can't be locked onto enemies in Fighter and Gerwalk modes. That is only possible in Battroid mode, for which the gun is the primary weapon, along with head-mounted lasers for point defense. In Fighter mode the Valkyrie is fastest, but has a low turning rate. The Gerwalk Valkyrie can strafe left and right and move backwards and forwards. The Battroid can walk on ground and employ jump jets, useful for missions on the surface of planets or inside Zentradi ships. All three modes can dodge enemy missiles, but the Gerwalk must be airborne to do so.\n\nCompleting missions with a good rating by shooting down many enemies with a high hit rate and taking few to no hits awards the player trading cards which unlock additional Valkyrie models not appearing in the campaign that differ in capabilities and armament. These can be used in Free Mode to replay any of the campaign missions. A tutorial mode that explains the game's controls is also available.",

        "description": "A young man and his father are the newest residents of Long Life Town, a strange little town with even stranger characters. It is here that he meets the girl of his dreams - literally. But she wants nothing to do with him. The young man's mission is to improve his reputation among the many inhabitants of the town until they allow him to kiss them, and impress the girl of his dreams with his acts of kindness.\n\nChulip is primarily a puzzle-solving adventure with a few role-playing elements. The player can freely explore the town, trying to figure out what to do next and how to do it. Kissing people is not as easy as it may seem; actions required to allow a person to be kissed range from waiting for the right moment to more difficult and branching puzzles like helping someone find a job. The more people the hero ends up kissing, the higher his heart meter goes, which allows the player to progress through the story and attempt more challenging tasks.\n\nApproaching angry townspeople, doing something they don't like, or injuring himself through various means will take away the protagonist's hearts. When all his hearts are gone, the player must restart or restore a saved game. Hearts can also be regained by sleeping, eating, and certain other tasks. Money is earned by kissing Underground residents (who only show up at certain times of the day), or by selling items found in the garbage. It can be used to buy various items that may help the player get further into the game, or train tickets to travel to new areas.\n\nCreated by a team that has split off from Love-de-Lic, the game shares many stylistic and gameplay-related traits with Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (the overall goal of making people happy, exotic characters, \"gibberish\" language with subtitles, day and night cycle, character schedules, etc.).",

Alyssa is about to inherit a great power, and the mysterious stranger, who is closely related to her but keeps his identity hidden at first, is out to get it.\n\nBut before she does so, Alyssa must pacify a couple of souls in her adventure, who needs to be laid to rest, by returning to them items of sentimental value. Even though they are dead, she has the ability to interact with them and bring them happiness in the end. However, in order to do so, she will have to uncover clues that piece their stories all the while being chased by serial killers which killed those who she is trying to help. During her search and exploration, she cannot directly fight the serial killers, but will have to look for places to hide or try to outsmart them, stun them or evade their attacks since outrunning and outgunning them is not an option.\n\nIn the end, when Alyssa pacifies the lost souls, she gets to face each of them in combat. Armed with nothing but bow and arrow, the combat revolves around lots of running and attacking from the distance, using different types of arrows to stun and ultimately defeat the killers pursuing her.

Things have moved on in the rally-driving world, as they have with this, the fourth title in the series. This time the player is in the vehicle of their choice.\n\nWhile the game features improved graphics over the older titles in the series the biggest improvement is the handling in the game, which is now based on real-world physics. Where the previous titles' handling of the cars made use of one pivot point, the new physics engine has four pivot points, each wheel interacting independently of the others.\n\nThere are four championships modes: 2WD, 4WD, Group B and Expert. 2WD is for beginners. 4WD is the next step up, offering an intermediate challenge. Group B features cars from the '80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting.\n\nThere are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece. There are also over 20 cars to unlock, including the Team Ford Transit van.",

Humanity only has one hope left: a team of five beautiful-yet-deadly female android soldiers.

Each stage consists of multiple shooting-gallery sections where the player must destroy oncoming insects against a video backdrop. These are connected by short scenes of the characters interacting, moving the story forward. Certain sections also feature basic third-person walking and shooting in the vein of Resident Evil.\n\nIn both modes, the player must watch their energy level, which powers both the characters' shields and weapons. Energy can be swapped freely between them, but getting hit by enemies will deplete the red bar, and firing the weapon will deplete the blue. If the blue bar is empty, the player cannot fire, and if the red bar empties, it's game over and the stage must be restarted. Depending on the number of enemies destroyed on each, stage bonus videos and energy refills are earned.",

The manual only lists 60 of the keys, scattered over 6 random pages and many of them are wrong. For example, the manual says \"J\" is Spooky's stealthy syringe attack when in fact \"J\" removes the enemy uniform he is wearing (generally leading to his speedy death). Veteran gamers might think of pausing the game to look up a needed hotkey in the configuration menu. Unfortunately, the config screen can only be accessed by saving and exiting the current game which then counts against your final mission rating.\n\nSome keys can be identified by right-clicking the action area to see available equipment and the readme file lists most of them correctly but on the whole, unprepared gamers are in for a great deal of frustration before they manage to memorize the important commands.\n\nGerman version\n\nIn the German version all blood, burning enemies and swastikas were removed. The intro and outo cutscenes were re-cut to remove swastikas, Hitler and war imagery. A detailed list of all changes can be found on schnittberichte.com (German).\n\nSales\n\nIn 2001, Commandos 2 (Windows) won the Gold-Award from the German VUD (Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland - Entertainment Software Association Germany) for selling more then 100,000 (but less then 200,000) units in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nAwards\nVerband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland\n2001 - Gold Award\n\nInformation also contributed by Xoleras.\n\n More"

It has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war.\n\nMissions are performed behind enemy lines and have specific objectives (infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, assassinate an opposing general, ...). Team members can be sent orders (attack, retreat, follow, stay, ...) or controlled individually. On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper. Each soldier has different skills that improve as they kill more enemies and gain experience. This results in them doing a better or faster job (Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase). In some missions, the player drives tanks or jeeps around while other squad members man the guns on the vehicle. At the end of each mission, the soldiers can be awarded medals for their bravery\n\nThe game also features up to four-player co-op, each player controlling a soldier in the squad.",

        "description": "Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set sometime after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. Crunch's power source is a set of magical masks known as the Elementals, each representing a different element, including Earth, Water, Fire, and Ice. The warp room splits levels into their respective elements, with the boss of each section being a battle against Crunch influenced by the Elemental mask of said section.\n\nThe game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.",

However, after handing development of the game over to Traveller's Tales and granting Konami the right to publish the game in Japan, the developers were given only a year to complete the game, resulting in the design change to a standard Crash game.\n\nVoice Cast\n\nThe game has a lineup of celebrity voice talent, including Mark Hamill, the voice of Luke Skywalker from Star Wars, and Clancy Brown, the voice of Mr Krabs from SpongeBob.\n\nComedic Elements\n\nThe game, whilst not strictly having a comedic narrative, does feature some comedic elements; for example, the character Uka Uka, who is nearly always seen screaming at Dr Cortex and never talks \"normally\". This is emphasised almost immediately as the first cutscene for the game begins with him yelling \"Imbeciles! Fools! Nincompoops! Can't you idiots do anything right?!\" at Cortex and his henchman.\n\nKonami\n\nAll versions of the game were published by Konami in Japan and Universal Interactive elsewhere. The PlayStation 2 version erroneously displays the Konami logo both in-game and on the cover in regions outside of Japan. This was fixed in the Xbox and GameCube versions.\n\nRegional differences\n\nThe game has a different title theme in the Japanese version, which uses a light-hearted, lyrical song; this can be compared to all other versions of the game, which use the warp room song.\n\nLoading Screen\n\nThe game has a different loading screen on different versions; the GameCube version had the word \"LOADING\" on a plain black background, the Xbox version has Crash falling through a green, 3D space and the PS2 version has Crash falling through a purple space whilst facing the camera.\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2002 \u2013 #2 Best Xbox Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\n\nInformation also contributed by Chris Chidester\n\n More"

        "description": "Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks, and even underwater, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.\n\nIn the main Arcade mode, there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token, the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.\n\nNext to the Arcade mode, there is an Original mode and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed-down courses. In the regular modes, it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race, the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B, or A, with S for outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version, there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers' different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).",

Specifically, Sega claims that The Simpsons: Road Rage gameplay is too close to that of Crazy Taxi. It was eventually settled in private.\n\nThe abstract for the patent reads as follows:\n\nA driving game, wherein players having various driving skills--from beginners to those advanced--may enjoy both aspects of amusement and simulation in consistency. The game device of the present invention has an element for providing to a player a plurality of different movement modes upon moving the vehicle along a traveling line. Upon selection of a desired movement mode, a vehicle-driving game relating to the driving mode selected by the player is executed. Included in this plurality of driving modes are an assist mode in which auto-brake control is performed and a training mode in which various indications, such as the timing of the braking point, are given.\n\nThe full patent is available here.\n\nProduct placement\n\nProduct placement at its best: Kentucky Fried Chicken, Tower Records and Levi Jeans. Each one is present as a location in Crazy Taxi.\n\nInformation also contributed by Terrence Bosky\n\n More"

Instead of being able to open separate restaurants, as in the last game, this time players can expand their restaurant vertically with the ultimate restaurant towering an entire nine stories. Players can also travel into town, where they can buy supplies for their restaurant or chat with friendly faces. There are eight different romanceable heroines, and players may be able to fall in love and pursue unique endings if they become close enough with one. In the adventure mode, players can set out to explore the world with their allies; they can being magical dishes with them, letting them take out monsters with flashy cooking magic. Players can collect special rare recipes on their adventures and bring them home, giving them new and exotic meals to attract customers.\n\nAlthough mostly identical, there is one small difference between the PS2 and Xbox versions: each features a unique cast member who isn't available on the other platform.

Locate and use a variety of weapons including a shotgun, rifle, pistol, truncheon, crossbow, flame-thrower and mortar gun. Find clues, characters and puzzles to help you discover the location of the sacred statue.\n\nDuring the game, realtime 3D cut scenes, interactions with NPCs as well as visual and audio messages provide more information to advance the story line. Gameplay is in 3rd person with action scenes reverting to 1st person.",

For many, the creation of the Virtuaroids (VR) began a new age as the 49-foot mechanical giants gained the attention of everyone and anyone nearby. Noticing this, business makers used the opportunity to create a new form of entertainment upon the surface of Mars. Known as Limited War, the performances drew crowds the universe over. It wasn't until corporate greed appeared once more that things began to fall out of control.\n\nThose in power began to fight each other for a stake in the new events, leading to internal fighting and crime. A special investigations unit was formed, in hopes it would eliminate such crime and bring order back. They are known as 'MARZ', and as a member of that team you must use your new found position to your advantage.\n\nIn each mission, you will control your own VR and must defend or attack a number of key locations and other VR units. Over time you will gain new additions to the machines armour and weapons which will aid you in later missions. You'll also unlock bigger and more powerful VR's as well.",

Each night, he hunts Creeps along with his partner Yuriel Arlencloyn, a white-winged Angel of Heaven. However, one night during their hunt, they happen to rescue a girl named Natsuki who recognizes T\u014dya as her classmate. Normal humans are not meant to know of such things as Shinigami and Creeps; with T\u014dya's own past shrouded in mystery to even himself, and Natsuki also interested romantically in T\u014dya, things quickly become complicated...\n\nD\u2192A:BLACK is a so-called \"active novel\" -- a visual novel-style adventure game with realtime battle sequences, divided into six chapters. The story unfolds from T\u014dya's point of view, largely through voiced dialogue sequences with still images. The player must occasionally make choices that will affect how the story plays out and which of the 11 endings are reached; some decisions are timed, and in many cases not answering at all is also a valid option.\n\nAt certain points in the game, the player will be attacked by Creeps. Controlling T\u014dya, his partner Yuriel, and his familiar Rin, the player must defeat the attacker and defend their team in a real-time battle. Each of the characters has various actions they can perform; T\u014dya and Yuriel can attack, defend, and use special moves, while Rin can defend or recover the other two characters. Each character has an affinity; T\u014dya's attacks are Dark, and work best against Light enemies, while Yuriel's attacks are the opposite, and Rin can switch between alignments. If any character's HP reaches 0, the battle is lost and the game is over.",

In multiplayer up to 8 players can compete in succession or 2 players can compete head-to-head.\n\nA karaoke mode is also provided for use with a wireless microphone (sold separately) whilst 'Aerobic' Mode calculates the number of calories you've burnt during play.",

You improve your character through a slow progression of leveling up from experience points and finding better equipment or purchasing it from villagers. Each mission you accomplish improves the economy, research or military stats of the village you are doing it for, which is what determines which items they have available for purchase.\n\nThere are three basic monster-types: Undead, Forgotten and Mutants. There are seven basic types of melee weapons. Two each do extra damage to each type of monster and the final does extra damage to groups. There are also four kinds of guns and a variety of bombs.\n\nThe object of the game is make Anna into an all-powerful warrior through battling and questing before a year is up and the Shadow Lord attacks. This takes upward of 100 hours of game time. At this point, she must defeat the Shadow Lord for good.",

        "description": "400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more: the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie.\n\nDark Cloud is an action-RPG title, often compared to Soul Blazer, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another.\n\nToan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes.\n\nEach character in Toan's party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as \"experience\" for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon's abilities. Each weapon features a number of \"slots\" to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to \"build up\" to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.",

        "description": "Endorsed by the then England and Manchester United captain and international superstar, David Beckham Soccer is the last of Rage long tradition in developing soccer games. It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams, with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as \u201cOwin\u201d or \u201cZanetee\u201d), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team. Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock \u201csecrets\u201d.\n\nGameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator. In terms of options, the game doesn\u2019t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)",

Additionally as this is an engine-based cutscene you can hack the console with a Game Shark and use the naked model in-game.\n\nReferences\n\nOnce again, Ryu Hayabusa from Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden series makes an appearance. This time, one of his bonus costumes is the outfit he wore in the old NES game trilogy.\n\nSex\n\nThis game shamelessly used as marketing a plug it's lineup of female fighters both before and after it's release with a series of..uhm...\"suggestive\" official swimsuit images released before the game, and the inclusion of, among other things, catwoman suits and schoolgirl uniforms as bonus outfits in the PS2 release.\n\nShadow Man\n\nThe European Dreamcast version has a Shadow Man costume for the character Zack, since it was released by Acclaim, the publisher and developer of Shadow Man.\n\nInterestingly enough, all following versions of DOA2 (such as Hardcore or the upgraded version on DOA Ultimate) still feature Zack's Shadow Man costume, despite the fact that Acclaim wasn't involved in any of them.\n\nVersion differences\n\nThe only real difference between this version and its others is the lighting effects. In the PS2 version, the lighting was very bright and made it kind of hard to see. In fact, there have been some reports of people having eye problems from the lighting.\n\nThere are six versions of Dead or Alive 2 so far: First came the original Dreamcast port which was pretty much a carbon-copy port of the original arcade release, then the PS2 port which added a few extras but had some graphical issues. The lighting was very bright and made it kind of hard to see. In fact, there have been some reports of people having eye problems from the lighting. An expanded Dreamcast port then followed which included all of the extras from the PS2 version which was then followed with the \"Hardcore\" release that fixed most of the graphic glitches and added tons of extra material. Finally, even more stuff (such as conceptual galleries and story events) was added for the Japanese \"Hardcore\" release.\n\nThe sixth and final version is the X-box remake Dead or Alive Ultimate, which uses Xtreme Beach Volleyball's engine and adds even more stuff as well as online play.\n\nInformation also contributed by karttu, M4R14N0, NightKid32 and Zovni\n\n More"

        "description": "Dead to Rights is a 3rd-person shooter in which the player is Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, he finds the dead body of his father. While trying to find the murderer, he is framed for another murder. Jack becomes a fugitive; his run from the law will take him to various places, from strip joints and hotels to office complexes, and even prison, as an inmate.\n\nWhen controlling Jack, players can perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, or tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. If Jack does not have a gun drawn, he can disarm an enemy which causes him to steal the enemy's gun, then performing some sort of finish, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as the game progresses.\n\nPlayers will sometimes have to control Jack's best friend and partner, his K-9 dog Shadow, which allows enemies to be killed from a distance. In addition, Shadow will fetch their guns and bring them to Jack.\n\nThe game also features \"adrenaline combat\", similar to \"Bullet Time\" from Max Payne. Jack will then perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving him an advantage, as long as his adrenaline meter holds out.",

The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You've been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for your ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.",

The back cover reads...\n\nThe aliens known as the Manti have been destroyed by Defender pilot Mei Kyoto when she helped the AI called Memory crash the moon into Manti-occupied Earth. The remnants of humanity that live on the Solar Colonies have been saved, but at the cost of their homeworld. Several years have passed, and Kyoto has become a controversial figure. While some view her as a hero, others demonize her as the destroyer of Earth. Kyoto would like nothing better than to be an anonymous rookie pilot again, but without the Manti threat to keep the Solar Colonies unified, friction has developed between the human outposts.\n\nDetroit Adams -- now a general and head of the Galactic Stargate Authority -- has convinced Kyoto to use her celebrity status as a goodwill ambassador to the Colonies, in the hope of keeping them unified... or at least prevent open hostilities from breaking out...\n\nReferences\n\nIn several of the missions, there is a mad scientist named \"Dr. Mudo\".

        "description": "Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed \"gray death\" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as \"Ambrosia\" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization \"Silhouette\" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters.\n\nDeus Ex is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points, which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.\n\nAnother way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant JC abilities that can be used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased, and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to them.\n\nThe game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits, as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways, e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games, the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use, and discard various types of objects.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\n1001 Video Games\n\nThe PC version of Deus Ex appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nAlex Denton\n\nSomewhere in Area 51 (the last stage of the game) you can see a number of containers with clones in suspension. One of them is called Alex Denton. Alex Denton is the lead character to the successor Deus Ex: Invisible War.\n\nBooks\n\nEver wonder about the books found in Deus Ex? The Man Who was Thursday by G.K. Chesterton is a real book written in 1901, and takes place in a fantasy version of Victorian England, in which anarchists take names of days of the week it has some similarities to Deus Ex. G.K. Chesterton also wrote a book about St. Thomas Aquinas whom is referenced several time in Deus Ex.\n\nOne of the many books you can read in Deus Ex is the beginning of The Eye of Argon by Jim Theis. This is a real book, considered by many to be the worst fantasy book ever written. Information about the book and the full text can be found online.\n\nCancelled Linux version\n\nThe Linux version of Deus Ex was supposed to be ported by Loki Entertainment Software. Unfortunately, they went bankrupt back in 2001. Although their company website still exists, it (obviously) hasn't been updated. The status of Deus Ex in the website is \"coming soon\". Not likely.\n\nNon-lethal\n\nDue to the array of non-lethal weapon and the numerous stealth options, it is quite possible to finish the game having only killed three people. That's a pretty non-violent option for a first person shooter! With the explotation of glitches, the number can be dropped to one.\n\nReferences\nThere's a register in the hotel at the Hell's Kitchen location... click on it and you will see that the last name is Hyppolita Hall... a character from the Sandman comic books.\nOne of the computer passwords used in the game, \"reindeerflotilla\", is actually a reference to the 1982 movie Tron, where it was used by Flynn to hack into the computer network and challenge the MCP (the time when he's actually inside the Encom building).\nThe helicopter pilot Jock with which J.C. Denton allies himself in the game is possibly a reference to the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the opening scenes of that movie, Indiana Jones makes a getaway in a biplane, flown by a pilot also named Jock.\nMain voices of JC Denton and Agent Navarre are eerily similar to the protaganists of Nocture... as well as their general appearances.\nA couple of tidbits. JC Denton was supposed to have a famous ancestor with the Initials J.C. If you look at the game logo, you see a very stylized J and C rotating around a tiny sphere.\nCastle Clinton, as well as the Statue of Liberty, are real buildings represented in the game as playable maps.\nIn the hotel, in NYC, check the guest register. One entry is, Gabriel Syme, from London, England. Syme was the title character in the novel, The Man Who Was Thursday.\nSpecial edition\n\nBeware the \"special edition\" that's being sold for $9.99 in bargain bins at Best Buy, Circuit City, Target, etc. This is a one-level demo being passed off as a full retail version. Unlike other legitimate bargain bin software, the Deus Ex being sold in the bargain bin section is only a demo and not the full game.\n\nEidos has a nasty habit of releasing game demos disguised as full retail versions and pedalling them in bargain bin software racks (they've done this previously with Tomb Raider). Nowhere on the packaging is it mentioned the \"special edition\" is a demo and not the full retail version of the game.\n\nTitle\n\nThe title \"Deus Ex\" comes from the latin term deus ex machina. It means- 1. A god introduced by means of a crane in ancient Greek and Roman drama to decide the final outcome. 2. A person or thing (as in fiction or drama) that appears or is introduced suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty.\n\nTwin Towers\n\nIf you run around Liberty Island, you can see the New York skyline. The Twin Towers are missing because allegedly, they were destroyed by terrorists. This was a design decision for a game released before September 11, 2001.\n\nVoice acting\n\nLots of Ion Storm employees were used as voice actors. Tom Hall plays the villain in the game; Jay Franke, a QA tester, played the protagonist. He used to be on the TV sitcom California Dreams.\n\nAwards\nGameSpy\n2000 \u2013 Game of the Year\n2001 \u2013 #18 Top Game of All Time\n2011 \u2013 #3 Top PC Game of the 2000s\nPC Gamer\n2000 - Game of the Year\nOctober 2001 - #10 in the \"Top 50 Games of All Time\" list\nApril 2005 - #27 in the \"50 Best Games of All Time\" list\n\nInformation also contributed by Adam Baratz, Alan Chan, Dr. M. \"Schadenfreude\" Von Katze, emanjonez, Entorphane, Jason Musgrave, jeremy strope, MasterMegid, PCGamer77, Ryan Prendiville, Scott Monster, Stephen Atkinz; Tomer Gabel and WildKard\n\n More"

Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and as his power builds he transforms into a demon state where he can use his power against evil he encounters.\n\nCommencing his battle against the demonic legions with just a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory, Dante will soon come across more powerful weapons, such as a shotgun to aid him in his mission. However, to defeat the devil Dante must also discover special weapons possessing various elemental powers. When channelled correctly these weapons will allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and launch powerful attacks against a range of enemies.",

The different parts of the amulet can be equipped to change aspects of the characters Devil Triggers form like elemental moves, time stop abilities, faster movement, flight abilities, etc.\n\nThe game is the debut of Dante's iconic sword the Rebellion. Dante also has new abilities like running on walls, aerial kicks, and multi-directional shooting. Lucia utilizes two underhanded, curved swords and also rapidly throws knives at her enemies.",

Many years have passed since his work in New York, and he now works for the Century City Police Department (CCPD) in Los Angeles.\n\nYou are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now-adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy.\n\nThis game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game.\n\nThere are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dually for the ultimate killing spree.",

However, on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rubble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start trembling...\n\nDisaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management, fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.",

        "description": "After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back.\n\nThe Overlord's castle acts as a hub to manage the party. It has shops to get new equipment, a gate to the different battles, a NPC to travel to the Item World, which is used to boost items, and the Dark Assembly, where the player can create new units, and have the assembly vote to pass (or not) special laws that will affect the game. To unlock some characters, a special chapter must first be unlocked by the Assembly.\n\nThe story progresses in the form of chapters. In each chapter, new battles become one after another, with dialogues at the beginning and end of those battles. Any completed battle becomes available to play again, sometimes with minor changes. At the end of every chapter, a parody cut-scene announcing the next chapter,(most often, it is Etna who tells the story as if she were the protagonist) is shown.\n\nBattle In a similar style to Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle, Disgaea is a turn-based strategy RPG on an isometric grid. Characters are dispatch in battle one after another, and each have a move action and an battle action. Each class has its own set of abilities, ranging from simple attacks and area attacks to magics that can affect all the battlefield. In each battle, up to ten bonuses can be obtained by clearing the Geo Panels and defeating enemies to fill the Bonus Gauge. The battle is won when all enemies are defeated, or, in the Item World, by accessing a gate to move to the next floor.\n\nThe Item World The Item World is a world divided in floors, inside any of the player's item. The goal of the Item World is to progress through the floors, which raises the item's level. The more enemies are defeated before moving to the next floor, the more the item will improve. A special king of enemies, Residents, can be found in the Item World. These have their own level, and add a bonus to the item in which they reside. Once a Resident is defeated, it is \"subdued\", its level doubles and it can be moved between items. Residents can be fused together to get better bonuses. This is necessary because each item has a maximum number of Residents it can contain, determined by the item's rarity (common, rare or legendary) .",

In each level, the main goals might include picking up one or more special items, or simply finding the exit. Sulley has to make his way across platforms, ladders and conveyor belts by jumping, climbing, flipping switches and pushing crates around. Enemies are rare, but Sulley can take them out with a whack of his tail, which is also used to break crates that contain items. There are also stealth sections, where Sulley has to avoid being seen by another character. Since the game is intended for younger players, there is no limit to the retries to any level, and helpful hints are always available.\n\nEach level also includes a number of collectibles and special tasks. There are 100 discarded screams to pick up - finding a certain percentage of them unlocks mini-game bonus levels. There are also 5 scream canisters to find and a small challenge involving scaring 5 mice within a time limit. If both are completed, clips from the movie are unlocked.",

        "description": "The evil wizard Merlock has kidnapped intrepid reporter Daisy Duck. Donald Duck wants to rescue her, and his friend Gyro Gearloose's latest invention, a teleporter, can help. Unfortunately, it can't reach Daisy directly due to a lack of power. To increase the energy, Donald must place weather vanes that catch gamma rays at the world's highest summits: the peak of Duckie Mountain, the Beagle Tower in Duckburg, and the flying mansion of Magica De Spell. Only then can the teleporter reach Merlock's temple so Donald can free Daisy.\n\nDonald Duck: Goin' Quackers on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube follows the same story, general gameplay style and level themes as the versions on other platforms, but features unique level designs, enemies and gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe game is a platformer employing 3D graphics, offering three different styles of level in a manner similar to games in the Crash Bandicoot series: the camera is either placed behind Donald as he runs forward, at his side (emulating classical side-scrolling platform gameplay) or in front of him in levels where he is chased by a giant hand and must run towards the screen.\n\nEach level must be completed within a time limit. There are many holes and gorges Donald must jump over, traps to avoid, as well as enemies he can dispatch by hitting or jumping on top of them. Picking up 100 golden gears gains Donald an extra life while collecting five within a second or less spells out one letter of the word SPECIAL. Once the word is completed and the level finished, Donald's nephews will teach him a special move. These moves make him invincible for a short time and result in the gears being worth more when picked up. To activate a move, Donald must jump on three enemies in a row without touching the ground, then pressing the activation button to begin entering a unique button combination within three seconds.\n\nWhen Donald is hit by an enemy or hurt by a trap, he gets in a grumpy mood (indicated by his trademark quacking) and the next hit means the loss of a life. Picking up a milkshake will restore his good mood and health, however. Should he find a glass of orange juice, he becomes Hyper Donald for a short time, allowing him to run over enemies and crash through walls to find hidden areas. Stashed away there (but also sometimes in plain sight) are golden threads. Picking up all three per level unlocks bonus costumes that Donald can change into in Gyro's lab.\n\nEach of the four worlds features three or four levels, plus a training stage and a boss fight. The boss fights follow the classic template of each boss repeating an attack pattern that must be avoided, as well as a single weakness that can be exploited to finish them off.",

The main objective is of course to be the first one to cross the finishing line but prize money is also rewarded for stunts - opportunities for them are plentiful on the 27 courses. An important point about them is that they are branching, meaning they feature multiple paths and shortcuts.\n\nCash is used to improve the athlete's abilities, e.g. new combat moves, or to buy better equipment and bikes. Besides the career mode there are also multiple additional playing modes, e.g. training, multiplayer, freeride, time trials or BMX Cross with special challenges. The athletes, bikes and upgrades are licensed.",

In a desperate attempt to rectify the situation the mayor reluctantly asks the mad scientist, Dr. Muto, to use his Genitor 9000 machine. However, the machine winds up destroying the majority of Planet Midway. In order to restore the planet, Muto must go out searching for isotopes, Terra, and pieces of the Genitor 9000 that got scattered on the four planets that Burnital Industries owns.\n\nGameplay involves collecting the aforementioned items. While the isotopes can be found all over, the Terra pieces are collected by completing challenges. and the Genitor pieces are earned by defeating a planet's boss. Each planet also holds seven scrap parts for Muto to find. Collecting the scraps will give Muto a new gadget to use such as rocket boots or an invisibility suit.\n\nWhile Dr. Muto can jump and zap enemies, he is also able to morph into several different creatures by using his Splizz Gun. Muto can morph into a mouse, spider, gorilla, fish, or a pterodactyl. This is necessary as the creatures have unique abilities such as the mouse being able to fit into tight spaces and the pterodactyl having the ability to fly.",

        "description": "Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire. Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...\n\nThe player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.\n\nLevels that have been visited before might become \"Expedition Missions\" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.",

        "description": "Drome Racers is a futuristic combat racing game based on the LEGO (Drome) Racers line of construction toys from 2002. Drome Racers features on- and off-road racing in vehicles that resemble their LEGO counterparts, with some designs being completely new.\n\nThe game focuses on the Career mode, where the player takes the role of Max Axel, the driver of the newly-formed Team Nitro, one of the six racing teams in Drome, a large elliptic racing arena with many different natural and urban surroundings. All drivers compete in a set of Multi Challenge Races (MCR), which are a series of connected races. At the start of each MCR, a drag race determines the pole position, while in all subsequent races, the position, and delay at which the driver approaches the starting line is determined by the results of the previous race. Hence, whoever wins the last race of an MCR, wins the MCR itself. There are 9 standard tracks available, and each one has A and B variations (up to half of the track can differ), and can be driven in forward or backward directions, resulting in 4 ways to drive on each track. Three MCR categories exist; Novice, Intermediate, and Expert, with the opening MCRs of each category unlocking new tracks. Different times of day and weather conditions are also featured.\n\nAfter a certain number of MCRs, individual drivers will challenge Max to race in all four variations of a track. Finishing in fourth place or better (or just first in challenges) earns upgrade points (which can be used to improve the engine, turbo, aerodynamics, tires, and armour), and finishing certain MCRs or challenges earns build tokens, which can be used to unlock new cars. All cars can be driven with automatic or manual gear changing, except for manual-only drag cars.\n\nScattered on the tracks are health and weapon powerups, as well as accelerator pads. Each car has four measures of health - the less health it has, the slower it gets, and when it loses all the measures in the health meter, some (non-essential) parts can fall off the car. Various weapons add to the arcade nature of the game and help drivers maintain their position or press forward.\n\nJoining Max in Team Nitro are Rocket, a retired driver who arranges practice and challenge sessions and gives tips on the game mechanics; Shicane, the team's mechanic who informs Max of the upcoming races and manages the garage (cars, upgrades, and unlocking); and Slot, the analyst who follows Max' statistics and enables saving/loading of the Career mode progress. They assist Max in winning the 2015 Drome championship and dethroning the current champion, Sever from Team Exo Force.\n\nIn addition to the Career mode, players can choose Arcade mode and the Quick Race mode (which is the same as Arcade, only with randomized settings). These modes only feature tracks that have been unlocked in at least one saved game from the Career mode and can be played by one or two players in local split-screen multiplayer.",

It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide.\n\nBut there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals.\n\nThe player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo.\n\nDropship simulates a massive, global conflict, with the player taking part in all the action.

But because of the dark thoughts in people's minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world.\n\nYears later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people's dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other's goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together.\n\nIn Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the seven keys. Each dream is different as each person is different, which means that the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems - even the boss is a giant money bag.\n\nWithin the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.\n\nIn order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.",

        "description": "The sequel to Dynasty Tactics gives the player more tactics to choose from, and introduces some new characters and features.\n\nLike in the first game, the player assumes the role of 3 important leaders in ancient China: Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Ce. A new choice is the warrior Lu Bu. The characters have their own, unique story paths, which are affected by choices and outcomes occurring during the chapters the game is divided into. The player organizes and moves his officers and armies over the map while engaging others, trying to fulfill certain objectives during a turn limit.\n\nFor battles, the game switches from the map to a dedicated screen showing the battlefield. The battle system is a bit like chess: the player moves the units around the battlefield in a turn-based fashion, mostly trying to bring them in a position to pull off special tactics. Ideally, this results in effective combos, that may not only defeat enemy units, but also capture the leading officers, which may join the player (there are over 200 in the game).\n\nMorale and terrain need to be taken into consideration as well. Units have different abilities depending on their type and position in the army, Engineers may build useful installments like supply depots for example. Army strategists can use the link command retained from the previous game for pinning down enemy units and helping to rack up higher combos, in addition, they may order chains now. These allow individual officers to perform multiple tactics (provided the conditions are met for each of them), but cost morale.\n\nThe game also contains a two player versus mode, which consists of random battles.",

        "description": "About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.\n\nThey followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.\n\nDynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.\n\nMost completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.",

In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as \"Musou Mode\"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).\n\nThe difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.",

Both novels are part of the Uplift series, and guess what: very intelligent dolphins play a big role in the series.\n\nExtras\n\nIncluded with the European version of this game is a product catalogue that showcases amongst other things the unreleased Half-Life port for the Dreamcast.\n\nInformation also contributed by Bolley Bollington"

        "description": "Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg-shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the playfield before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.\n\nThere are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial, and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.\n\nCompared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise, they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.",

The main character is Jade Cornell, a foxy redhead, whose friend Tyler has gotten too close to the truth. The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins.\n\nThe game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter.\n\nThe environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity.\n\nFinishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.",

A mysterious voice contacts him and says that this world is called Endonesia, and if he wants to return home, he has to call upon its fifty gods. In order to find the gods, the hero has to communicate with the inhabitants of Endnesia by transferring his own emotions to others.\n\nCreated by Taro Kudo and Kazuyuki Kurashima of Love-de-lic fame, Endnesia is one of the spiritual descendants (along with Giftpia and Chulip) of their seminal game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure. Like those other games, Endnesia is a puzzle-solving adventure with RPG elements such as statistics, item-gathering, and character growth.\n\nThe theme of the game is sharing emotions; gameplay-wise, it translates into puzzle-solving which involves using the right emotion on the right characters at the right time. For example, using the Hunger emotion on an animal will make it hungry, urging it to find food, which will clear the path for the hero.\n\nSimilarly to Moon and its descendants, Endnesia has a day-night cycle. The hero's health meter is depleted due to exhaustion; though the game's world is quite large, the player always has a time limit for his daily activities. The player should also feed the hero; hunger makes his vision blurry and slows down his pace.",

Throughout the game, the player will be called upon to utilize Focus moves, which is basically bullet time from the films. When Focused, time slows to a crawl, allowing the player to zoom around enemies, dodge bullets, and jump to avoid oncoming obstacles.\n\nThe game was written and directed by the Wachowskis, and its plot is intertwined with that of the second movie, The Matrix Reloaded.",

The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine's mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it's up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way.\n\nEscape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango: mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object.

However, not much detail was put into it, and no secrets were revealed (both to try and persuade the player to buy the full strategy guide). The walkthrough that came with the PC version was written entirely in bright blue ink, screenshots and all. This was probably to deter \"helpomaniacs\", people who look up what to do next, and then regret they did.\n\nNames\nThe \"bad guy\" of the game is an Australian named Ozzie Mandrill. A mandrill is a kind of a monkey.\nThere is a character named Marco Pollo in the game. Beside being a parody on the famous traveler Marco Polo, the name also has another meaning: \"pollo\" is Spanish for \"chicken\".\nOn Melee Island (TM), if you ask I. Cheese about his family, he'll eventually tell you about his aunt who was so ugly people turned to stone when looking at her. He also tells her name: Gorgon Zola Cheese. \"Gorgonzola\" is a kind of cheese, while \"Gorgon\" is a name of a monster in Greek mythology: whoever looks at it turns into stone.\nReferences\nThe SCUMM Bar and LUA Bars appearing in the game are named after two programming languages. SCUMM is the language developed by LucasArts for creating Maniac Mansion (and then many other games), and LUA is a language developed in a Brazilian university.\nIn the Place of Prostheses, with the machine if you enter the right code then you can get one which has the name as 'Manuel J. Calaverus'. This is obviously referring to Manny Calavera in Grim Fandango.\nEscape from Monkey Island features a mini-game (obligatory to finish the game) called \"Monkey Combat\". No need to say it is a parody on the Mortal Kombat series.\nWhen you are in Lucre Island jail, if you look at the iron maiden, Guybrush would say, \"Iron Maiden! Excellent!\" This is refering to the movie Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, where they get arrested in ancient England, and the king says to send them to the iron maiden. Thinking they mean the rock band, Bill and Ted reply \"Iron Maiden. Excellent!\" then play the air guitar.\nOn Lucre Island (TM), the parfume stand is entitled \"Scents and Sensibilities\". This is a reference to Jane Austin's book Sense and Sensibility.\nOn Lucre Island, inside the swamp, you can see a crashed X-Wing there.\nAwards\nGameStar (Germany)\nIssue 04/2009 - One of the \"10 Most Terrible Sequels\" ( It changed the handling to annoying keyboard controls and many puzzles defy every logic and have to be solved through trial and error.

It also carries over several of ESPN NBA Basketball's improvements in controls and graphics.\n\nReturning game modes include Quick Play, Exhibition, Season, Legacy, Tournament, Practice and Gym Rat. The Legacy mode has redesigned menus and adds full season recruiting via assistant coaches, scout visits of high school games and a new trophy room. New modes include Rival mode, which lets players set up quick games that feature classic school rivalries, and Slam Dunk Challenge. The Challenge offers five different dunk competitions: Beat the Clock, Style, Horse, Dunk-O-War (who can fire up the crowd the most, needs to be unlocked) and a Championship of all modes. Dunks are executed through QTE-style pressing of buttons in the correct order in quick succession. Players can create their own schools in the new Create-A-School mode, allowing for customization of mascot, fight song and even floor type.\n\nOn the court, major changes include IsoMotion controls similar to those seen in ESPN NBA, which allow a variety of new offensive moves and manual stealing on defense through use of the right thumbstick. Also new are ability icons, which quickly indicate a player's special skill (speed, 3-point-shots, defense or star quality).\n\nThe game features many unlockables in the Campus Store. Currency for the store is earned by completing challenges on the court, which can then be spent to unlock mascot teams, alternate uniforms, professional and fantasy courts and classic teams.",

This mode allows you to play one season after another and comes complete with a draft and off-season player dealings, like signing and releasing players, governed by the real rules of the NFL, where trade deadlines and salary caps are standard.\n\nAnother new feature in ESPN NFL Football is a virtual apartment called 'The Crib.' The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game's menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.\n\nAnother feature added to this game is first-person football. This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it's like playing on the field.\n\nChris Berman again adds ESPN style commentary for the audio track.",

One day, Cain has a strange dream that brings back memories from his childhood, when his native country Solcia was invaded by the neighboring Aldine. All he remembers is that \"everyone went to the island\". This mysterious Island of No Return is presently of great interest to the king, who is trying to find why the Elders sent a research team there. The island is rumored to harbor a ring with unseen powers, and the king secretly dispatches Cain to investigate the fate of the people who had ventured there and disappeared without a trace.\n\nEternal Ring is a first-person action role-playing game similar in concept to King's Field series. It is focused on exploring interconnected dungeons, fighting enemies within. Compared to King's Field games, its world is smaller and less open. With a few exceptions, the only type of weapon Cain can use are swords. However, weapons play a relatively small role in the game, and there is also no armor. The gameplay system largely relies on magic spells that the player can gain by equipping special rings and imbuing them with gems.\n\nThe spells and the gems containing them come in six different elemental flavors: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, and Darkness. The player creates rings by experimenting with different types of gems, resulting in various effects. Up to six gems can be placed on both sides of a ring. Gems also have different levels which affect the outcome of the experiment. The resulting rings may modify Cain's attributes, increase his affinity for a particular element, provide auxiliary bonuses, or grant Cain powerful attack spells.",

Built on the ocean, this park is technology's latest word, and is at the first sight the most fascinating and secure construction of all. However, something goes wrong, and seven people - two boys and five girls - become trapped in the park. The danger increases as they face a mysterious virus that brings them on the verge of death.\n\nThe player controls two different characters: Takeshi Kuranari, a simple, normal Japanese teenager, and a mysterious boy with amnesia, who cannot even remember his name. The relationship between the characters becomes more and more tense as the story develops. Will the young people be able to solve the mystery and escape death?\n\nEver17 is the second game in KID's Infinity series. The game is not connected to Never7: The End of Infinity either by storyline or protagonists, but both games share the same \"dreamy\", semi-futuristic setting, and their stories have a similar style. The gameplay of Ever17 is that of a visual novel: the player reads dialogues and watches scenes, viewing them as one of the two protagonists, occasionally having to make decision as to what to do next and how to answer in a conversation. Those decisions influence the course of the story and lead to different endings.",

        "description": "A young swordsman named Darius and a homemaker named Sharline grew up together in Solta, one of the villages in the Fontraile empire. Solta is populated by people who bear strange marks known as crests. Ancient Billiana Trees cover the landscape shared by Solta and the neighboring Morea, and the two villages disagree as to their role: the people of Morea consider them sacred, while the people of Solta claim they suck out the energy of the land. Eventually, a war erupts, and Darius' parents are killed by assassins from Morea. The two young people have to follow each their own way to restore justice and peace.\n\nEvergrace is an action role-playing game. The player can follow Darius and Sharline through two separate storylines, and switch between the two characters at save points. The game allows players to switch between characters at any save point. Experience is gathered by using items and equipment rather than by leveling up a character directly. Equipped items can also be combined with special items to increase the parameters of the characters.",

When Dennis arrives at the facility he finds out that something horrible has occurred, and must fight for his life as he encounters mutated creatures and is in danger of getting infected himself.\n\nExtermination is a survival horror game. The player character has limited ammunition for his firearms and in many cases it is advisable to run away from monsters. Besides the traditional health bar Dennis also has an Infection Rate, which may gradually grow when attacked by monsters. Once his Infection Rate reaches 100% he becomes very weak and would eventually mutate into a monster. Infection can be countered by applying MTS vaccines.\n\nThe player character's default weapon, a special purpose rifle, can be customized with enhancements such as zoom scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to other weapon types such as flame thrower, shotgun, or rocket launcher. Dennis can also fight with a knife. Throughout the game batteries must be collected and used for activating various machines and saving the game.",

It was also EA Sports' first F1 game that was released after the covered season.

Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother.\n\nWhile inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku.\n\nIn order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be \"charged\" by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera's attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.",

On the same property, there lie three detached residences that surround the mansion, all of which are rumored to have ties to the mansion\u2019s troubled past. It\u2019s said there is an underground network of tunnels that lay beneath the premises, but nobody knows who made these tunnels or what purpose they served.\n\nMany inexplicable phenomenon have been reported occurring on the property. Bloody hand prints have been found splattered all over the walls. Spirits have been spotted on the premises\u2026 even in broad daylight. A narrow stairway leads to an attic where a spirit-sealed talisman is rumored to be locked away. Men have sought this talisman, only to be found later with their bodies broken and rope marks around their wrists. There\u2019s a crumbling old statue of a woman in a kimono, but its head is missing. If you take a photo of a certain window, a young girl can be seen in the developed picture.\n\nThese incidents have provoked fear in the people of Tokyo, and many believe that those who live near this area will become cursed. The deaths of those seven people are unexplained to this day.\"\n\nConsidering how this tagline does not appear on any other region's release, and how the only mention of the story appears online after Fatal Frame's release, this story was likely fabricated by TECMO's marketing division.\n\nLawsuit\n\nThe developer of Fatal Frame, Tecmo, was quickly sued by the movie company behind Ghostbusters, claiming that the idea of capturing ghosts in a camera infringed upon the concept of Ghostbusters. The case was later dropped.\n\nNovel\n\nThere's a novelization of the game. It's told from the viewpoint of Mafuyu Hinasaki and it's storyline is a little bit different. Unfortunately, its only in Japanese. It is called Zero: The Novel, ISBN 4840220654, available on The Japanese Amazon website.\n\nVersion differences\n\nThe European and American versions of the game differ from the Japanese version. The main character, Miku's appearance and outfit have been changed to represent more Western people rather than Japanese.\n\nInformation also contributed by Daedolon, Donatello, j.jones and Lain Crowley\n\n More"

The path disappears behind them as they enter the Lost Village, a place that vanished from the living world years ago. Ghosts of the townspeople walk the streets and search for the twins, intent on completing a dark ritual long left unfinished. Mayu begins to grow distant from Mio as well, and she begins to speak as if she were another person entirely. By chance Mio finds the Camera Obscura, and with its powers she searches for a way to get her sister and herself out of the village.\n\nFatal Frame II has mostly the same gameplay as the first game in the series, although with a few tweaks. The camera no longer has to charge up a shot, but different film types now have loading times that can leave Mio defenseless if she takes a picture at a bad time. Special abilities for the camera no longer require a disposable item, and are instead charged by taking good shots of attacking ghosts. The stats of the camera and special abilities are still upgraded/unlocked with spirit points, but an item must first be found and spent as well to upgrade each level of a stat.",

In Japan and North America the PS2 version featured ghosts of the creators as well as the editors from gaming magazines from the respective countries. In Europe these ghosts were replaced with contest winners. When the Xbox re-release came out these were replaced with yet another set of ghosts from another contest in Japan, although the European versions remained unchanged.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe idea of a camera absorbing ghosts is based on a superstition that having your picture taken steals your soul and the only way it can be returned is to burn the film. There are followers of religions around today that believe this to be true including places in Mexico. The ghosts you encounter are all lost souls.\n\nTitle\n\nThe original Japanese title Rei: Beni Chou means \"Zero: Crimson Butterfly\". The PAL release title is actually closer to the original than the NTSC one.\n\nUnlockable Clothing\n\nIn addition to the several sets of swimsuits for Mio and Mayu that were added for the Xbox Director's Cut, Tecmo also added outfits from other Tecmo games. Completing Hard difficulty lets Mio and Mayu dress up like the heroines of Deception II and III, while completing Mission Mode with any score rewards the twins with the costumes of Ayane and Kasumi from the Dead or Alive series.\n\nInformation also contributed by festershinetop and Lain Crowley\n\n More"

        "description": "Tidus is a young athlete who lives in a futuristic city of Zanarkand - \"the city that never sleeps\". He plays blitzball, a ball game where players throw the ball while flying around. Suddenly, a terrible disaster happens. A huge dark wave engulfs the city, spawning monsters. Tidus comes in contact with the mysterious creature, and as a result finds himself in a different world, a thousand years into the future. The civilization he is used to doesn't exist any more. He learns that the world he knew was destroyed by Sin, a terrible being that is believed to be indestructible. Tidus meets a young summoner named Yuna, and joins her as a guardian on her quest to put an end to Sin.\n\nFinal Fantasy X is Japanese-style role-playing game set in a world somewhat similar to South Asia. Only individual locations can be physically explored; there is no \"world map\" in the game, and exploration is fairly linear. Enemy encounters are random; the game abandons the series' traditional ATB (active-time battle) combat in favor of a Conditional Turn-Based Battle system, in which the turns of the participants are determined by characters' stats and actions, with turn order displayed in the upper corner of the screen.\n\nThe game also departs from the usual leveling up system. There are no character levels in the game: instead, experience points received after battles can be allocated by the player directly to upgrade the characters' parameters. Each character has his or her special \"sphere map\", with straight or branching paths containing spots that increase the character's personal statistics, or teach him or her active and passive abilities. The characters are given distinct class attributes, and it is possible top switch between all the party members during the same battle. Monster summons (called aeons in the game) now behave like playable characters, have their own hit points (HP), and can fight for the party until defeated.\n\nConversations that occur during cutscenes have voice overs, for the first time in the series. The game features various mini-games, the most prominent of which are blitzball tournaments.",

The language in actuality is a simple substitution cipher. All the vowels equal other vowels (to make actual pronunciation easier), and the rest are the normal letters. Anyone that can do cryptograms can decipher the language right from the beginning of the game, without find all the Primer books. But finding the books makes it a lot easier to read the subtitles.\n\nCut content\n\nThere is an un-intended sequence at the beginning where you can defeat the monster that chases you into the ruins. Obviously they had a change of plans when developing the game. You can view this sequence by using a PS2 Gameshark and enabling high stats.\n\nMusic\n\nFinal Fantasy X is the first game in the (main) Final Fantasy series where the music is not exclusively composed by Nobuo Uematsu, only a modern remix of the prelude is present (not the actual prelude) and there is no trace of the traditional \"a a a a a a g g\" battle theme baseline. Although the battle theme of Final Fantasy VII & VIII does not start by this baseline, there is trace of it in songs herd during some important boss battles.\n\nAlso, it's the second game in the series where there is no presence of the Final Fantasy theme since Final Fantasy II.\n\nReferences\n\nWhile in the Besaid Village the first time, go to the Crusaders Tent. Talk to the first character in the door, and he'll tell you \"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in\". Obviously a few of the programmers were Beatles fans.\n\nWorld map\n\nAs of 2002, Final Fantasy X is the only Final Fantasy game that doesn't have a world map with a character moving around. The world map is actually a menu with a locations to choose and a \"search\" option, that allows you to go to any location on the map.\n\nAwards\nGameSpy\n2002 \u2013 Z.Flo Award (for Yuna)\n\nInformation also contributed by Aaron A., Bregalad, Unicorn Lynx\n\n More"

        "description": "Final Fantasy X-2 is the first direct sequel in the history of the series. The events of the game take place two years after Yuna and her guardians defeated Sin in Final Fantasy X, and peace was restored in Spira. The Yevon religion has all but disappeared, and two political factions begin to compete for dominance: the Youth League, led by Mevyn Nooj, and the New Yevon Party, led by Praetor Baralai. Meanwhile, Yuna's cousin Rikku finds a strange sphere that mysteriously shows an image resembling Tidus, Yuna's one and only love. Rikku brings the sphere to Yuna. Determined to discover the truth behind the mystery, Yuna organizes a journey of \"sphere-hunting\", to collect more spheres scattered around the world and perhaps find Tidus.\n\nThe sequel brings back the ATB (active time battle) system, which was replaced by turn-based combat in its immediate predecessor. The battles develop at a somewhat quicker pace than earlier games in the series, with more emphasis on quick decision and timing. The player can control only three characters throughout the game, all of them female: Yuna and her friends Rikku and Paine. The job system similar to that of Final Fantasy V is featured, with the possibility to learn various abilities and customize character classes. Limited jumping and climbing are now possible in certain locations. The game's structure is less linear than in most other games belonging to the genre. Though there is only one way to advance through the main story, the player can opt to visit most other locations early in the game, since the airship is available already at that stage.",

Her eyes are like that because she is half Al Bhed. If you notice Rikku's eyes, they are both green with swirl patterns because she is a full-blooded Al Bhed.\n\nDevelopment\n\nSquaresoft originally planned to make two spin off titles to Final Fantasy X. One was to be focused on Yuna, and the other on Rikku. However, that idea was scrapped, and both characters play a central role in this game.\n\nMusic\n\nKumi Koda did the motion-acting for the opening. In the Japanese version of the game, she sang the theme song and voiced the character Lenne.\n\nStory\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 is the first Final Fantasy game to continue a storyline from a previous Final Fantasy game.\n\nVersion differences\n\nThere are two FMVs that are sort of like concerts, one where Real Emotion song is sang (intro) and one called 1000 Words (1000 no kotoba for Japanese version). US version, of course, dubbed even the songs, but there's much more to it. Seems like SquareSoft changed the FMVs for US market as well. In 1000 Words FMV you will notice that Yuna and Len are singing together and you'll see more of Len singing, whereas in Japanese version you can only see Yuna shifting to Len and vice-versa.\n\nVideo collections\n\nSquareSoft released on July 16, 2003, a set of three separate CD/DVD combos called Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection (name), where (name) stands for either YUNA, RIKKU, or PAINE. Each of double-cases holds CD with two vocal as well as instrumental version of FFX-2 songs, that in the game appear only as instrumental tracks, and a DVD that is comprised of a music video of first song from the CD, an interview with the singer (voice-actress for original Japanese game version), and a theme trailer for each of the three main female protagonists. In addition to that, each case holds manuals that contain full lyrics, once fully opened form a smaller version of poster with pre-rendered picture of Yuna, Paine, and Rikku.

        "description": "Final Fantasy XI Online is an MMORPG which is played in the persistent medieval world of Vana'diel. This base version was only released in Japan. The final North American release includes the Rise of the Zilart expansion pack and the XBox 360 version includes two more expansions: Chains of Promathia and Treasures of Aht Urhgan.\n\nCreate your own character by choosing your race, gender, face, body size and job. The five unique races are: Hume, Elvaan, Tarutaru, Mithra (female only), and Galka (male only).\n\nBeginning jobs include: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage and Red Mage. More jobs, such as Bard, Paladin, Beastmaster or Ranger, become available after certain quests are completed. Players can change their job at any time, but only in their Mog House, and each job has its own experience pool and level. They also each have unique traits that are acquired by leveling up, and their own set of abilities. The latter are not acquired by leveling, but by using scrolls bought from shops or acquired in special job quests. Each scroll requires a minimum level to be used. A second \"support\" job can also be set and changed at the Mog House by completing a special quest. The support job level is always maxed at the half of the main job level, rounded down. The character has access to all abilities, skills and traits from both jobs at their current level. The second job also adds to the characters stats. The maximum level a character can attain by gaining experience from battles and quest is 50, but, thanks to the game updates and add-ons, that maximum can eventually be raised to 55, 60, 65 and so forth, up to level 100 by completing the corresponding quests. At level 75, the character gains the ability to gather experience in a separate pool rather than the level pool, to earn merit points that can be spent to improve some aspects of the character.\n\nJoin other players to form a party of up to six players, on even an alliance of multiple parties, on various servers to fight the evil beastmen, the other species from Vana'diel (Orcs, Goblins, Quadavs, Yagudos, etc.). You can communicate with other players in your group using text and body language. A special device called a linkshell can be used by a group of players to communicate with each other, like in a chat channel.\n\nTraveling through Vana'diel can be done by foot, on airships, riding a Chocobo, or by teleporting to the outposts scattered in each area. To teleport to a selected location, a supplies quest must first be completed. Next to each outpost is a book that enables special trainings. By defeating specific enemies, the character will gain extra experience and gils from those training manuals. Once engaged in a battle, the character will hit the targeted enemy if it is in range. Additional actions can be selected from a list, or used via a macro system. Aggressive foes will pursue their target until it has moved to another area.",

Also, coincidentally, the first massively-multiplayer online role-playing game to have a discernible beginning and ending, with a story line that every player can experience at any time.\n\nSales\n\nAlthough wildly popular in the US (with more than 500,000 subscribers as of early 2004), the game was less so in Japan. Square-Enix made a public claim that unless they could get 200,000 Japanese players to sign up and play the game, it would not be exported to the US due to financial failure. The release of the PS2 version shot up in sales enough for US players to get the game.\n\nVersion differences\n\nThe Windows base game was only released in Japan. The Xbox 360 version includes the three expansion packs. Both the Windows and the PlayStation 2 version were launched in North America with the first expansion pack Rise of Zilart included. The European Windows version includes the first expansion as well as the second: Chains of Promathia.

Once Sumio discovers a place he can examine, he uses his partner, \"Catherine\" \u2014 a briefcase that can jack into anything and discover secrets. After finding the correct jack to hook up to the object with, Sumio must input a code to unlock the secret and solve the puzzle.

You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into \"freakout\" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.\n\nFreekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.",

The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as \"Durandal\". Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz's gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity...\n\nFront Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.",

Each week they bid to take part in races aiming to end the year with the Rookie Of The Year contest after which they progress through successive to become Leading Jockey.

The player is not guaranteed races on good horses until they have experience. Initially they must bid for races on unproven horses and impress the trainers by finishing higher in the standings than predicted.\nAll races are viewed from the traditional rear, 'jockey's backside' point of view though the L1/R1 buttons do provide a sideways view and, when held down continually a rear view. During the race the player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost. By using the whip on both left and right the horse can be raised to it's 'Go' state - motivated for the final surge.\n\nThe game boasts over two thousand unique horses, and sixty five AI opponents each season",

        "description": "Fancy hats, oval turf tracks and people waving tiny bits of paper on the stands. Welcome to the world of horse racing. While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market.\n\nThe player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It's impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed.\n\nDepending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.",

        "description": "Gadget Racers is a racing game in the Choro Q series. This title differs slightly differently compared to other games. There are no RPG elements to this game, with tracks and races chosen through a menu system similar to a Gran Turismo title rather than talking to other cars.\n\nThe player starts by choosing one of six car bodies. Later the other bodies can be purchased through the shop, along with other variants (bodies are purely cosmetic). Upgrading the player's vehicle is done by buying parts. Many of the parts are normal for racing games (engines, tires etc.) with some more specialized parts like wings or skis. Money is gained by completing races, a bonus is added depending on your position.\n\nGame modes included are: Sprint, Grandprix, Engine Regulation, Endurance, Off-Road Regulation, Body Type Regulation, Parts Regulation, and Duel.* Sprint races are simple and standard races in three difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate and Upper)\n\nGrand Prix requires licenses gained from the Driving School, once gained the GP choices are as follows:\n\nEngine Regulation races are dependent on the horsepower of your engine, and are ranked in 3 classes (Light, Middle, and Heavy)\n\nEndurance races feature more laps than the regular races. There are only 5 tracks included in the mode\n\nOff-Road Regulations tests the players ability to handle off-road situations. Three grades are available: Dirt Mini, Dirt Big and Dirt HG.\n\nBody Type Regulation races are split between 8 styles, and is based on the body type of the player's vehicle\n\nParts Regulation races are designed with the special parts in mind.\n\nDuel races are one-on-one races between the player and the computer",

The story is told from the perspective of Keita It\u014d, an average teenager who by sheer luck is admitted into the prestigious Bell Liberty Academy. Keita enjoys his stay until his admittance is revealed to be a mistake, as Keita has no special skills that place him in line with the elite that attend the school. Frustrated with this turn of events, Keita attempts to confront the school's chairman before receiving an email from the man himself, informing him that if anything will keep him in the school, it's his amazing luck which in itself is an admirable ability. The next day, a contest begins to determine the MVP of the school, and Keita must use this opportunity to prove to the chairman and the entire student body that he deserves to be a part of Bell Liberty Academy. Here, Keita and a partner of his choice embark on their quest for total victory and eventual romance.\n\nThere are 10 characters which Keita can pursue a relationship with, each with different endings. There are also bonus scenarios, unlocked by completing routes in the main game. The PlayStation 2 version introduces voice actors for the characters, with full voice acting not seen in the original PC game.",

        "description": "Galerians: Ash continues directly the story told in the first Galerians. Five hundred years into the future, an ultra-intelligent mother computer named Dorothy was given the responsibility of managing humans' lives. However, the computer's mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy's creations, the Galerians.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of its preceding game, complementing a traditional survival horror scheme with the protagonist's unique abilities. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more \"addicted\" he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, the protagonist relies heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion's maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion.",

The player will start out with a small amount of Jockey Points that act as currency in this game, using this to start out their stable by buying a horse and entering them in races. Depending how well their horses and jockeys perform during races, they can continue to expand their empire and become the best in the business.\n\nNot only can the player act as an owner, on race day they can also become the jockey and use their horses strengths to win races in a variety of tracks. The player must play to their horse's strengths and avoid exposing their weaknesses through various weather conditions. If the player and horse does well enough, the horse's attributes can change after the match, but also be affected negatively if they do poorly.\n\nThere is also a Practice mode where the player can learn how to play the game through the various modes and even have the ability to bet on horse races, however this can only be done on this mode. Players can also go head-to-head in a split-screen, either with default horses or ones from their season mode.",

        "description": "A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never-ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal.\n\nThis version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.\n\nThere are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.\n\nUnlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.\n\nWhile levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.",

        "description": "Gekibo 2 is the sequel to Gekisha Boy. It is a fast-paced side-scrolling game where the player controls the junior photographer Pete Goldman working for the newspaper Planet Times in Japan. In each stage the goal is to photograph as many weird or funny situations as they occur in the environment while the screen scrolls to the right automatically. The player has minor control over the character's movement as the focus is on moving the cursor used to snap pictures. It is possible to capture any part of the environment and pictures are lined up in the bottom right side of the screen. Correctly captured gags and unusual situations remain there, while the others fly away and are discarded. A score is built up based on the performance.\n\nThis second game uses a different graphical style, replacing the flat 2D design with full 3D stages allowing for vertical movement while the characters are cut-out sprites similar to PaRappa the Rapper. This 3D depth introduces a new function where it becomes possible to zoom in on action in the background. It is now also possible to lock the cursor, useful to line up shots while avoiding hazards. A flash ability that clears the entire screen removes all obstacles such as a skateboard for instance, but can also reveal secrets such as hidden scenes and areas, and even completely new levels. It can only be used a few times per level shown through the number of bulbs available in the bottom left corner.\n\nSnapping situations provide film rolls that act as \"ammo\" that can be picked up and are required to keep on photographing. Often quick reflexes are needed so as not to miss situations or to avoid obstacles. Compared to the first game the amount of film is more generous, but the action is now much faster. Collisions with hazards can also be avoided using a new dash move or by snapping them. Some of the locations in the game are The Ginza, theme park Harajuku, spooky spot Odaiba, downtown Katsushika, gynmnasium Yoyogi, the historic town Tsukiji and the zoo in Ueno. There are three difficulty levels.\n\nPhotographs are stored in an album as a way to get an overview of every possible scenario to capture. There is support for the PlayStation Printer peripheral where the front page of a newspaper can be printed with one of your pictures in a prominent position. Pictures from the album can be printed as well. Picture Paradise is supported too, allowing players to use a camera to insert themselves into the game. That way the game can be personalized by giving random pedestrians the faces of friends or family members.",

You control two characters, Ben and Ginji, who possess special powers that allow them to find and to recover items, valuables, and even people who got lost. Now they are offered a huge sum of money for a recovery job they have to do for a mysterious customer from an even more mysterious Castle of Infinity.\n\nThe gameplay is based on exploration of randomly generated dungeons. You search for items and also trigger important cut scenes by exploring every corner in the dungeons. The action-based combat resembles a fighting game. You can perform a variety of moves, block your opponent's attack, and switch between the characters. Attacks deplete your stamina bar, so continuously using the strongest attacks is not always the best choice. When your stamina bar is full, you can perform powerful combo attacks.",

After unwittingly unleashing hundreds of ghosts from a containment facility, including one that took a liking to Lazarus' partner, it's now his job to travel to the four corners of the earth and recapture them. This is going to be one long night.\n\nLazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren't much use against the incorporeal. Eventually he will find energy weapons that can drain away a ghost's energy, and when a ghost has been sufficiently weakened it can be captured with Lazarus' homing \"Ghost Grenade\". Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way: shooting them until they stop moving. Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him. She has to be careful however as she has no way to attack or defend herself.",

        "description": "On a far away planet, three races fight for control of the few landmasses available: the marooned Meccs, who specialize in firearms and other things that go boom, the mystical and cold-blooded Reapers, who were the original inhabitants of the planet, but were forced to live in the sea by Kabuto, the third character; a truly gigantic monster with a ravenous appetite and a fondness for performing wrestling maneuvers on those the size of his hand.\n\nYou can control any of these races (although in the single player mode, you have to progress through the storylines of the Meccs and Reapers first) in their bid to be the dominant species. Each species varies in the way they play the game and have vastly different types of attacks available to them.\n\nGiants: Citizen Kabuto is an action/real-time-strategy game that emphasizes action. While there is base-building and resource management for most of the races, it is done through a simple to control interface and one or two keystrokes. The majority of the game is spent in a third person view (first person mode is available) jet-packing/warping/leaping about the 3D landscape. Single player sessions consist of missions with specific goals, such as rescuing Smarties or recovering lost items. Multiplayer options include standard deathmatch, capture the Smartie (flag), the above with basebuilding as an option.\n\nOther creatures also inhabit the islands. From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the flora of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention).\n\nGame controls are similar to Shiny's MDK and can best be described as a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto's howls, are for fun and show).\n\nThe alien world in the game is bright and presented with vibrant colors. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.",

        "description": "Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance is an action game that takes place in the times of the Roman empire. You take control of Invictus Thrax, a Roman slave, who ascended through the ranks to become champion of all gladiators. Favored by the emperor, Invictus was to be granted his freedom. Mysteriously though, the emperor was killed and replaced by a crazy man named Arruntius. Arruntius, so full of himself, has decided to destroy Rome and replace it with a city named Arruntium. As the game begins, an epic event is staged with Invictus as the gladiator. Invictus fights bravely, but he is killed by an unknown and possibly un-human creature. In the afterlife, Invictus meets the sons of Jupiter. They inform him of how Arruntius' power came from help of the gods of terror. They charge him with the task of eliminating Arruntius and restoring Rome to glory.\n\nGladiator is essentially an 3d action/combat game which features hand to hand combat with weapons, combos and magic. The action also includes maneuvering around, from gliding down ropes to jumping traps. Challenges are scattered around the game world, which when defeated, unlock magical powers granted by the gods, such as Pluto's power, which raises spirits from the dead to help you in battle. A unique feature of the game is the execution maneuver. Upon the near death of certain enemies, you can execute this maneuver which will result in a cinematic random brutal execution by Thrax.\n\nThe game's graphics try to recreate the atmosphere of gladiator films such as Spartacus. A wide range of characters are featured from opposing gladiators to mythical enemies like cyclopes, demons. and skeleton warriors. Audio features include a blend of soft and hectic tunes, and voice over acting.",

Acclaim planned (not sure how this turned out) to place advertisements in UK bus shelters that would bleed. For six days, cartridges behind the ads would spurt red dye which would spill out on to the ground (and cleaned up at the end of the one-week campaign).\n\nCredits\n\nWatch the credits for humorous \"outtakes\" and other surprises.\n\nGerman Releases\n\nTwo versions of this game were released in Germany: an uncut version with the red USK age rating logo and a \"modified\" version which qualified for the USK 12 age rating. The modified version is easily recognised by the German subtitle Schwert der Rache (i.e. Sword of Vengeance), the uncut German version still has the English title, although the package blurb and the manual are in German. The games are identical, there simply is one gory version and one with reduced violence for the \"younger players\".\n\nHistorical References\n\nIn this game, Romulus and Remus are presented as the children of Jupiter. In traditional mythology, they are identified as the children of Mars and are responsible for founding Rome. Romulus is said to have killed Remus, so we can guess who's wearing the comedy mask and who's wearing the tragedy mask in the game.\n\nThe Dark Gods of the game, Phobos and Deimos, are called the \"errant children of Mars.\" Errant maybe, but they belong to the Greek mythic tradition which places them as the children of Ares. They represent the aspects of Fear and Terror. Interestingly, Acclaim has much of this information on their web site.\n\nHistorically, Emperor Trajan reigned from 98-117 AD (or CE). This game is set in 106 AD/CE but the story allows for any discrepancies. Trajan's achievements were set in stone, the famous Trajan Column, and he was followed by Hadrian, famous for the Hadrian Wall.\n\nSales\n\nSales of this game were clearly far below the expected levels. Enough to have contributed to Acclaim's bankruptcy? You decide. Lot number 2013 in the \"pick the bones\" auction of Acclaim's assets consisted of Nineteen Thousand One Hundred Seventy Three (19,173) unsold copies of Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance for PC.\n\nInformation also contributed by ClydeFrog and partykiller.\n\n More"

        "description": "Go Go Golf is a player golfing game for one to four, where there's only one human player the game provides the opposition.\n\nThe player(s) play as one of eight predefined golfing characters, each with their own strengths, on three golf courses which can be played in three ways:\n\nStroke Play: here the match is played over eighteen holes and the player who completes the round in the fewest strokes wins\n\nMatch Play: where it is the player who wins the most holes who takes the match, here if a player is, say, five holes ahead with just four remaining they are declared the winner\n\nTour: Here the objective is to win more than $1.5m in one season. In order to achieve this the player must win a qualifying match in May so that they can compete in a major tournament. There are four major golfing tournaments in Japan in June and July, two nationals the All Japan Masters and the Asian Open, and two internationals the International World Classic and the World Classic. By winning the nationals the player can progress to the internationals and the big prize money. Games can only be saved during a tour\n\nThe game has an unusual, one button, style of gameplay. Cross is used to initiate a stroke. As the player shapes up to take their swing a shadowy outline appears behind them and the player must press Cross again at, or near to the top of the swing, the game does not allow Cross to be used beyond the top of the swing. On the downswing the player must press Cross again at the point of impact. With each press during the back and down strokes the player sees a message ranging from \"Too Fast\"; \"A Bit Too Fast\", \"Correct\", \"Perfect\"; Amazing Skill\", through to \"Too Slow\" and others.\nClub selection is automatic and the player cannot make their own shots, with most approach strokes the player has a choice of three shots to play and on the green there is only one shot option.\n\nThere is no course or hole flyby in this game, no gimme's, no mulligan's, and no character creation. Neither the eight players nor the three courses are based on anyone or anywhere in real life. In-game the player can view the ground ahead before they play their shot but all camera viewpoints are automatic.\nAll matches are played over eighteen holes, none of that 'front nine', 'back nine' rubbish here.",

        "description": "After leaving San Andreas and going on a crime spree throughout the country, Claude Speed and Catalina head to Liberty City for a life of crime. During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime. Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude. Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process. Now it is time for revenge. Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others. Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way. It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III is similar in its concept to its predecessors: the player is cast in the role of a vicious (albeit novice) criminal, who performs tasks for crime lords and gradually raises his rank in the criminal world. Driving is the main gameplay element in the game, though the player can also fully explore the city on foot. For the first time in the series, the entire game is rendered in 3D. Different camera angles are available for driving, and free camera rotation is available when on foot.\n\nAs opposed to the previous games, Liberty City is the only city the player can explore in the game. The game puts more emphasis on the story, displaying cutscenes before each mission. In order to complete the game, it is necessary to perform all the main story missions; however, the player often has the choice between several missions at a given moment. The missions include chases, races, short third-person shooter sequences, as well as various mini-game-like activities. Outside of the missions, the player is free to explore the city and undertake sub-missions, for example working as a taxi driver, delivering sick people to the hospital in an ambulance car, etc.",

Rockstar/Take-Two are working in conjunction with the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia to release a revised version of the game in January 2002. A few copies of the game were sold there before the ban was put in place.\n\nAfter lengthy talks with the Office of Film and Literature Classification, DMA removed certain sexual content and the final version has been approved. However, many people are asking for an R18+ rating to be added to the games rating system (which currently only goes up to MA15+, meaning restricted to over 15) so this will not happen again.\n\nCancelled port\n\nA 2D driving-based version was in the works for a release for the GameBoy Advance, but it was ultimately cancelled.\n\nControversy in Japan\n\nShortly after several Japanese prefectures planned to legally ban GTA III's sale to minors, a 17-year-old Japanese fan of the game stabbed his parents. The coincidence of these two events sparked an effort in the Japanese game industry to work on an ESRB/PEGI-style rating system.\n\nCut content\nA multiplayer mode was planned for the PC version, but later cut.\nOriginally, the player had to solve missions for a homeless man named Darkel. There are many rumours about him being a terrorist with missions like blowing up a bus full of children or flying the dodo into a building (sometimes connected to Donald Love's sudden disappearance). Because of the last bit, it is rumored that the character was removed shortly before release because of the terror attacks of 11 September, 2001. The official line is that the mission rumors are baseless, the character was cut because he didn't fit into the game and his missions were sub-par, and he was removed several months before release.\nFlashback radio\n\nThe playlist for Flashback radio is:\n\nRush Rush - Deborah Harry\nShake It Up - Elizabeth Daily\nScarface (Push It To The Limit) - Paul Engemann\nShe's On Fire - Amy Holland\nI'm Hot Tonight - Elizabeth Daily\n\nIf it sounds familiar, that's because all five songs come from the 1983 movie Scarface.\n\nGerman release\n\nThe German PC version is censored - no blood or gore is to be seen. Also missing are the rampage missions, the possibility to hurt people with melee weapons when they lie on the ground and money left behind by killed people.\n\nProtagonist\n\nThe silent main character formerly known as \"Fido\" (among various other aliases) is actually named Claude. This is discovered if you listen carefully during one of the phone calls in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It is rumored that Claude is the same Claude as Claude Speed, from GTA2.\n\nRadio stations\n\nA number of the fake radio advertisements that fill the game's wonderful made up radio stations have real websites registered by the designers.\n\nFor example, www.pogothemonkey.com will take you to a small website where you can play with Pogo and listen to all the 'reviews' of his new 'game'.\n\nReferences\n\nIn one mission for Asuka Kasen you have to stop an undercover cop named Tanner. Tanner is also the name of the main character in the Driver games, where he is an undercover cop.\n\nReferences to the game\n\nIn August 2006, Coca Cola launched a new TV commercial inspired by the scenery and gameplay of GTA III. At first, you seem to witness car chases, robbery and theft, but the tables are turned and the main character pays for his products, helps old ladies, and extinguishes fire. The link to the video can be found in the related links section.\n\nSales\nThe Playstation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto III has sold over seven million copies, and is now known as the highest selling game ever for the console. Sony has signed a deal with Rockstar making sure all future GTA games are PS2 exclusive until 2004.\nGrand Theft Auto III is listed by Guinness World Records as the first full sandbox action-adventure and the biggest selling game of 2001.\nSecrets\nIf you look hard around the city, you'll find little notes pasted on walls or signs like the infamous 'You weren't supposed to be here you know' sign on the wall, or the secret website links.\nIn Staunton Island, look for the internet cafe, and go inside. Check out what's on the computers.\nStadium\n\nIt is impossible to enter the stadium via normal means. Although by using several cheats you can get the tank to fly over the stadium.\n\nIf you look at the layout of the seats within the stadium the different colours spell out \"Cocks\"\n\nWindows version\n\nThe PC version allows players to use their own MP3 files for ingame music. You can copy the files to a directory in the game directory, the game will then add the radio station \"PLAYER'S MP3\" which will be automatically used in random cars (or can be selected with the change radio button).\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2001 - Game of the Year\n2001 - Action Game of the Year\nComputer Games Magazine\nApril 2003 (Issue #225) \u2013 Game of the Year (Editors' Choice)\nApril 2003 (Issue #225) \u2013 Game of the Year (Readers' Choice)\nApril 2003 (Issue #225) \u2013 Funniest Game of the Year\nMarch 2003 (Nr. 148) - #6 in the \"10 Best Games of 2002\" list\nComputer Gaming World\nApril 2003 (No. 225) - Game of the Year 2002\nEGM\nFebruary 2006 (Issue #200) - #9 on the \"Greatest Games of Their Time\" list\nElectronic Gaming Monthly\nApril 2002 - Game of the Year (Readier's Voting)\nGame Developer's Choice Awards\n2002 - Game of the Year\n2002 - Excellence in Game Design Award\nGame Informer Magazine\nOctober 2004 (Issue #138) - One of the \"Top 25 Most Influential Games of All Time\"\nGamePro (Germany)\n2011 - #3 Handheld Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\nGameSpy\n2001 \u2013 Game of the Year\n2001 \u2013 PS2 Game of the Year\n2001 \u2013 Most Offensive Game of the Year\n2001 \u2013 Best Use of Radio of the Year\n2002 \u2013 PC Action Game of the Year\nGameStar (Germany)\nIssue 01/2007 - One of the \"Ten Most Influential PC-Games\".

        "description": "Tommy Vercetti is a gangster who just got off a fifteen-year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends. Because he didn't rat out his \"family\", Tommy's sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything. Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it's up to Tommy to clear a path.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same free-roaming driving and action gameplay style as its predecessor, but in a new setting based on the city of Miami. The game includes all the features of the previous installment and builds upon them. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of typical vehicles from the 1980s. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from GTA III. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat.\n\nNew to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFirearms are for the most part the same as in GTA III, and melee weapons have been added to the protagonist's arsenal. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Activities outside of the missions (driving taxis, delivering sick people to hospitals, firefighting, and playing a vigilante policeman) are available as well.\n\nTo effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured in the previous game) across ten radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, The Message by Grandmaster Flash, You've Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Out of Touch by Hall & Oates.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\n1001 Video Games\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nBugs\n\nOn the (North American) PlayStation 2 version of this game, memory card data can get corrupted when the game is saved at the Ice Cream Factory.\n\nCommodore 64\n\nThe second Rockstar Logo sequence that appears before each game pays homage to the Commodore 64. The blue on blue screen, the quality of the music, and even the load command accurately model the most popular home computer (especially for gaming) in the late eighties.\n\nControversy\n\nIn December 2003, the New York City's Human Rights Commission demanded that Take Two removed the phrase \"Kill Haitians\" from Vice City after Haitian groups complained about this.\n\nTake 2 responded:\n\nAs with literature, movies, music and other forms of entertainment, we have strived to create a video game experience with a certain degree of realism, which we believe is our right. Nevertheless, we are aware of the hurt and anger in the Haitian community and have listened to the community's objections to certain statements made in the game. Accordingly, we will remove the objectionable statements from future copies of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nDJs\n\nAmong the connections this 'prequel' has with the original Grand Theft Auto III are the return of younger versions of some of the radio DJs. * Lazlow (whose real life counterpart is responsible for writing a lot of the radio dialogue), the talk radio Chatterbox personality returns as a young DJ starting out trying to convince everyone that he's a hard core rebel on the rock and roll station, V-ROCK. * Toni (Maria Chambers), was Flashback-FM's aging pop groupie DJ in GTA III. In Vice City, she not only sounds younger and naive, but a good chunk of her material plays into her GTA III material (for example, yes, she HAS been on fire). Her 80\u2019s station? Appropriately enough, named Flash FM * And in a twist, Fernando Martinez (Frank Chavez), who ran the pseudo-legal prostitution ring ads euphemistically called 'Fernando's New Beginnings' got his start as a Vice City radio DJ on Emotion 98.3. In between playing emotive records, he\u2019s already begun his pimping ways.\n\nDundee\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City was created by Rockstar North, a division of Rockstar Games. Rockstar North was previously known as DMA Design. DMA Design was originally located in the Scottish City of Dundee. In 2000 the company moved to Leith in Edinburgh.\n\nLocated near the airport is a sign mocking Dundee. It has a picture of a ship on it (Called the RRS Discovery) and the word \"Dundee\" very similar to that used by the local council when promoting Dundee. There is also some text saying something along the lines of \"We have a ship that belonged to a loser\".\n\nFor more information on Dundee try www.dundee.com www.dundeecity.gov.uk\n\nGerman version\n\nOn March 29, 2003, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (PS2) was put on the infamous German index by the BPjS. For more information about what this means and to see a list of games sharing the same fate, take a look here: BPjS/BPjM indexed games. After the game has been banned in Germany, publisher Take 2 released a new, censored version. Rated 16, you can recognize the edited game by its white edges on the cover.\n\nThe changes are: * People on the ground can't be hurt with melee weapons * Blood effects when hurting people were removed * No decapitations * Killed people don't leave money behind * The Rampage missions were removed * Two regular missions were removed: Messing with the Man and Dirty Lickin's\n\nGuinness World Records\n\nAs of 2008, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is listed by Guinness World Records as the biggest selling game of 2002 and the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time.\n\nMovie studio\n\nIn the movie lot located in Prawn Island, there is some set that looks like Broadway. If you take a look, you\u00b4ll notice that is the set of Staunton Island (Liberty City) even with the same advertisements.\n\nReferences\nIn one of the assassination missions you get from the payphones the targets are called Nico Carter and Marcus Hammond which is a nod to the two main characters in the game The Getaway.\nThe remote control helicopter used in the mission 'Demolition Man' closely resembles the helicopter which is piloted in one level of Blood Money, a game developed by DMA Design (now Rockstar North) for the Commodore Amiga computer.\nIn the Malibu Club, the band performing on the stage of the club is an obvious parody on the Village People.\nSales\n\nVice City was a massive success for Rockstar. Electronics Boutique sold more than 500,000 copies on the game's first day of release, and more 250,000 in the UK.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nYou can buy the soundtrack in your record-store. But try to get the German version - it has more tracks on it, than the US-version, due to some copyright difficulties.\n\nSwimming pool\n\nThere is a mansion on Starfish Island, by the shore, with a peculiar swimming pool. If you look at it from above (looking south) you'll see that it has the shape of a woman's torso, and some rocks at its bottom look like a bikini.\n\nTelephone numbers\n\nYou can call the telephone numbers that are being advertised on the radio or elsewhere. They work.\n\nWeapons\n\nAs of 2009, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the only GTA game not to feature the AK-47.\n\nWindows release\n\nWindows version of this game was accidentally put on shelves 5 days before right release date. After that many gameshops put out this game 1 or 2 days before right release date.\n\nVice Point building\n\nFrom 23:00 to 00:00 in-game time, near the Malibu Club, the Vice Point Langer building's lit windows form a figure which looks like a penis. Every 15 in-game minutes during this time, a fountain on the top of the building is activated to give the impression the penis is ejaculating.\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2002\u2013 Best PS2 Game of the Year\n2002\u2013 Best PS2 Action Game of the Year\n2002 \u2013 #2 Best PS2 Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\n2002\u2013 Best PS2 Action Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Game of the Year\nComputer Games Magazine\nMarch 2004 - #2 Game of the Year 2003\nComputer Gaming World\nMarch 2004 (Issue #236) \u2013 Best Music of the Year\nGameSpy\n2002 \u2013 PS2 Game of the Year (Readers' Choice)\n2002 \u2013 Best Music of the Year (PS2)\n2003 \u2013 #2 PC Game of the Year\n2003 \u2013 PC Action/Adventure Game of the Year\nGolden Joystick Awards\n2003 - PS2 Game of the Year\nPC Games (Germany)\nIssue 02/2004\u2013 Best Game in 2003 (Readers' Vote)\nIssue 02/2004\u2013 Best Action Game in 2003 (Readers' Vote)\nPC Powerplay (Germany)\nIssue 07/2006 - #8 Best Packaging\nRetro Gamer\nOctober 2004 (Issue #9) \u2013 #15 Best Game Of All Time (Readers' Vote)\n\nInformation also contributed by Bob Shand, Emepol, Felix Knoke, [festershinetop](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,45521/), [Jeremy Petho](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,82141/), [keth](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,21778/), [Marshall Leslie](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,114570/), [Maw](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,49554/), [Medicine Man](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,130303/), [MegaMegaMan](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,45233/), [PCGamer77](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,1717/), [piltdown man](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,168784/), [Sciere](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,30979/), [tarmo888](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,24805/), [WildKard](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,16566/) and [Xoleras](http://www.mobygames.com/user/sheet/userSheetId,42761/)\n\n More"

Though scars of the battle still mark the land, time has passed and the people of the world have built new civilizations and kingdoms to colonize the planet. The \"Day of Darkness\" will someday occur, heralding the resurrection of Valmar.\n\nRyudo is a \"GeoHound\", a mercenary available for hire, usually for slaying monsters and recovering goods. Working with a talking bird named Skye, who sites on Ryudo's shoulder, they will \"do anything\" if the price is right.

Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player's party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.\n\nIn battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include \"attack combos\" (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, \"Critical Strike\", Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy's action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character's (and enemy's) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character's individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold, and items.",

        "description": "The Spirits, who once protected the world, have gone loose. Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits.\n\nGrandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.",

        "description": "Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice is a sequel to the first Growlanser; it is set in the same universe and timeline, featuring characters from the previous game. The story once again focuses on the war between the kingdoms of Rolandia and Burnstein; as opposed to the first game, the spotlight here is on the latter, as the player takes control of a young knight named Wein Cruz. Dreaming of becoming an Imperial Knight, the highest rank in his country, Wein gradually begins to see that not everything is the way it seems, and has to recount events from his own past, face injustice, and solve moral dilemmas concerning duty and friendship.\n\nThe gameplay mostly follows the template introduced in its predecessor. It is a tactical RPG (also called SRPG, \"strategy RPG\") with the distinguishing characteristics of the series: the real-time element in the turn-based battles. Physical attackers must actively move towards the selected target; mages require time to execute spell; instead of the traditional \"grids\" the movement range depends on the characters' speed parameters, etc. New to the series is the ability to equip unique \"Ring Weapons\", which can be enhanced by imbuing them with gems that have various beneficial effects on the character.\n\nAs in the first game, there is a strong dating element in Growlanser II. The player can choose to date several female characters in the game, choosing dialogue options and other decisions of the protagonist. The ending sequence is ultimately influenced by this decisions.",

        "description": "The events of Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness take place long before those described in the first game of the series, effectively making it the prequel. The entire planet is in danger, since the sun's energy is being gradually depleted. Two powerful countries try to seize control of the land: the kingdom of Aggressival and the Xironia Federation. The player takes control of Slayn Wilder, a young man with amnesia. Following a battle against Aggressival soldiers, Slayn is rescued by a girl named Annette, who turns out to be the daughter of the president of Xironia Federation. Together, they decide to uncover the secrets of Slayn's past, and find a way to stop the war and save the planet.\n\nGrowlanser III retains many elements of the previous games - free movement during battles, the addition of real-time element to the turn-based system, the Ring Weapon system from the previous game, etc. It also introduces new gameplay elements, such as magic combinations and skill growth. However, the most notable change in the game is the emphasis on \"pure\" RPG aspects and the reduction of strategy elements to the point that it cannot be qualified as a true strategy game. The party is reduced from eight controllable character to four; instead of being dictated by the story, most battles occur randomly; the player is able to physically move and explore the world map, towns, dungeons, etc.\n\nThe dating element is still present; instead of a branching storyline (as in the previous game), the dating largely depends on character creation (determining Slayn's blood group, etc.). Dialogue choices, however, are still plentiful, and different endings can be reached depending on the relationship level the player has reached.",

        "description": "When the humans created artificial beings named \"gears\" in 22th century, they didn't expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.\n\nGuilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.",

Each stage is very short, much in Wario Ware's vein (although these titles predate the Nintendo game). Time Crisis is the first installment of the famous Virtua Cop rival saga, made by Namco for the arcades and the Sony Playstation. The action is on rail with the character moving automatically after clearing each segment, the player can hide behind walls and objects while reloading and quickly studying the stage (time is limited though).",

        "description": ".hack//INFECTION is the first in a four part game series. It's a single player adventure / rpg that \"simulates\" an MMORPG (EverQuest, Ultima On-line) that has you playing the character Kite. You can get member addresses of other character and attempt to call them to in game to see if they are on-line to join you in a quest. Like standard MMORPG games, it has a LOT of side quests, lots of weapons and armor, a trading system for equipment among other character and the ability to move between different servers. You also have message boards and e-mail to communicate with other \"players\". Once you beat the game, you can still continue to play and level up your character and your character can transfer to the second game .hack//Mutation (May 2003). The story: Your friend talks you in to trying \"The WORLD\", the most successful on-line rpg in computer history. During your first adventure in the game with your friend (showing you the ropes) you come across a strange girl being chased by a weird monster, a strange incident causes your friend to go into a coma after the attack of unknown / hacked monster and you end up with this book that upgrades your character with an unusual gauntlet that allows you to hack in the game. Your quest starts out to find out what caused your friend to go in to a coma. This involves adventuring after sightings of the strange girl and hacking in to sealed levels. There also seems to be corrupted levels and something going on that the CC Corporation (owner of \u201cThe World) is trying to hide. .hack//INFECTION is part of Ban Dai's dot hack project that first starts with the Anime DVD series (.hack//Sign). The game series takes place after the events of the \"Key of Twilight\" and focus's on the \"Book of Twlight\". Each game in the series has a DVD episode of the .hack//Liminality anime series that show the events going on in the real world around the same time as the game.",

        "description": "The PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life is a port of the Windows game, but with a significant overhaul for the weapons and character models, as well as the overall map geometry and some extended levels.\n\nIt also includes an expansion pack that is referred to as Half-Life: Decay, which was never officially available as an expansion for the Windows game until it was eventually recreated as a modification. The third expansion for the original game, it features two-player cooperative gameplay (in split-screen) with the two female scientists Gina Cross and Colette Green as the protagonists. It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions. Singleplayer is also possible, but then switching between the two characters is necessary to advance. When not active, the other character is AI controlled for basic actions.\n\nIt is set at the same time of the events in the original Half-Life, but from the perspective of other characters. All enemies and weapons are based on the original game and many of the missions have a more friendly approach about working together or rescuing NPCs. Unique to the series as a whole is the lack of a single narrative; instead the add-on consists of fixed, separate missions. At the end of each mission, statistics are shown and the player is graded. When the nine levels are completed with an A grade, a bonus mission is unlocked where players control and work together as two Vortigaunts. As an additional bonus, the entire singleplayer can then also be completed as a Vortigaunt.\n\nThe game supports an USB mouse and keyboard for more precise control.",

        "description": "Happy Breeding (DC) also known as Happy Breeding: Cheerful Party (PS2) is a non-adult console port of a Happy Breeding adult visual novel for PC (Windows). While the original game had voice-acting, the console ports changed voice-actresses for some of the heroines. The story revolves around Takashi, who just started living on his own recently. One day, he finds a strange looking girl in his house and ends up living together, seeing how the house was too big for one person and all. It doesn't go too long before he finds himself living together with yet another girl, and yet another. All the girls are not entirely human and display animal traits such as dog's ears, cat's tails, and the likes. Thus his life on his own soon turns out more lively than he expected after leaving his parents. The game is a typical visual novel with basic features of the genre, static characters which only vary in poses, occasional animations such as rain effect, sound effect to indicate what is happening on the scene instead of seeing actual animations, fast-forward option during dialogues, and full voice-acting, but only for main heroines.",

During his time there, Harry's classmates are coming under a mysterious paralysis and Harry must get to the bottom of what is happening.\n\nThe game involves Harry being given objectives to complete along with him having to go to class to learn spells. The game also has some mini-game diversions such as playing Quidditch, dunking gnomes in water, and collecting wizard cards.\n\nOccasionally Harry will find himself in a combat situation. Harry can be equipped with up to three different spells at a time. If the player can make Harry cast a spell with correct timing, the spell will be more powerful than normal.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version was ported internally by Electronic Arts instead of by Eurocom who developed the other console versions, hence the PS2 version sporting some noticeable differences. but otherwise keeping the majority of the game the same. Some differences include the PS2 version of the game having an overall lower difficulty level plus when Harry is riding a broom he can land it anywhere instead of only in designated landing spots. Speaking of platform differences, the GameCube version has an exclusive feature that allows the player to connect to the GBA game and unlock a new Wizard Card.",

        "description": "Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action-adventure title.\n\nAfter a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.\n\nMost tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.\n\nAfter classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry's health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George's shop for more cards and some other useful items.",

        "description": "Quidditch, the broomstick and ball \u201csport\u201d of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation. For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven-player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other. For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and \u201cstrategies\u201d of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.\n\nThe game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for. Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams. As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as \u201cscore 120 points in one game\u201d) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves. Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with its own style and special combo moves. After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.\n\nPeople familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch. Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the \u201cgolden snitch bar\u201d. As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar. Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase. Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).\n\nBecause it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc\u2026). It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two-player (same machine) exhibition matches",

The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.",

        "description": "The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch's reign.\n\nHaven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot'Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders, spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasis on puzzle-solving and exploration.\n\nHaven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.",

        "description": "Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as \u2018Headhunters\u2019 to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry.\n\nYou are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you\u2019ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough\u2026\n\nHeadhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.\n\nBetween levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license.\n\nAs you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.\n\nJack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP\u2019s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot.\n\nJack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN. This is a wristwatch with video capabilities and a direct link to the LEILA database.",

Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units.\n\nThe goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out.

        "description": "The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives.\n\nTypically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards.\n\nThe guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies.\n\nHitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.",

On its main screen however, you can see a screenshot of IO's upcoming (at the time anyway) Freedom Fighters! Though if you look carefully (use 1st person view = F1) you can see a few changes in the interface, such as a radar screen added next to the health bars.\nIn the \"Jacuzzi Job\" mission check out what's on top the small counter in the bedroom... That's right! It's a Dopefish spring-toy! And for further Id related sightings check out the monitors in the previous \"Graveyard Shift\" mission: most of them are playing Quake III: Arena. Even the sysadm!\nAt the very beginning of the \"Graveyard Shift\" mission, you can see a video camera pointed at a coffee pot. The camera plays a part in one of the in-game puzzles in that mission. What you might be wondering is why anyone would dedicate a video camera just to watch over a pot of coffee. It's possible the coffee pot camera is a homage to this.\nOn the mission \"Shogun Showdown\", 47 enters a room with a lot of monitors and a big red button to press. In this same room, there is a bookcase. Looking on the titles of the books, you can find one titled \"Vamos Arrega\u00e7ar\". This is Brazilian slang for something like \"Let's kick some ass!\". It looks like they had a Brazilian guy in the development team...\nIn the first St. Petersburg mission, there is a building called \"Zaitsev Building\". It was obviously named after the famous soviet sniper Vasily Zaitsev (immortalised in the movie Enemy at the Gates). Quite fitting, if you think about progress of the misson.\nSergei Zavorotko\n\nThe game's main villain, Russian arms dealer Sergei Zavorotko, bears a remarkable resemblance to a character in Arnold Schwarzenegger's Eraser movie that introduced us to the joys of railguns.\n\nThat character, also named Sergei, was also a Russian arms dealer and a secondary villain who showed up at the end of the film. Both he and the Sergei from Hitman have surprisingly similar appearances. Both have shoulder length hair, a thick moustache, and both wear wool turtlenecks under a red leather coat.\n\nThe Sergei from Hitman is balding on top, while the Sergei from Eraser isn't, but otherwise the two characters look almost exactly the same. It's possible the character design for the Hitman Sergei was inspired by the character from the Eraser movie.\n\nInformation also contributed by Alan Chan, Carlos Aquino, James1, SGruber and Zovni\n\n More"

This object turns out to be a cosmic force, its power so great that it splits Yukito into three different entities, each composed of one part of his psyche. It also happens to give each part enormous psychic powers!\n\nHowever, he's only just started arguing with himself, when three different factions converge on him all at once. A trio of aliens, led by the self-aggrandizing scientist Olga Mengele, want to steal Yukito's power for themselves. Yuki and Yuka, a pair of sister demon hunters, believe Yukito to be a demon that must be sealed. And of course Hiromi Togo -- alias Trigun, defender of justice -- wants to use these events to prove herself as a superhero.\n\nHooligan is a superhero-comedy adult visual novel. The majority of the game consists of lightly-animated cutscenes and voiced dialogue, with occasional player choices that will branch the story and lead toward relationships with the various female characters. There are also several mini-games that occur throughout the game, most notably a simple card battle where the player must select cards to defeat the opposing characters in rock-paper-scissors style.\n\nThe PC version contains explicit sexual content, which was removed from the PS2 release. The PS2 version also contains fully-redone voice acting with a different cast.",

But now, your own life at its end, you find yourself at the River Styx with none other than Death himself as your guide. He tells you that you have a choice. You can let your soul be carried off to Hell, where it will suffer endless torment for an eternity, or you can attempt to be accepted at the Gate of Judgment, proving yourself worthy of being reborn as a human. Of course, the path there is long and wrought with peril, and only through your actions as you journey through the netherworld can you change your own fate.\n\nHungry Ghosts is a first-person adventure game with light action elements. The player controls the recently-deceased warrior as he travels through the afterlife searching for the Gate of Judgment. Many objects can be examined, collected, or interacted with in various ways. The protagonist begins the game with a spear and an empty crossbow, but can acquire and use a number of other weapons and items throughout the game. It is necessary to collect so-called Soul Fragments by helping out other lost souls, which will allow the player to progress through the next gate.\n\nEvery action in the game has an effect on the protagonist's fate. Simply reaching the Gate of Judgment is not enough to redeem him; the player will be judged accordingly on the actions they took to get there. For example, break open too many barrels and hoard every possible item, and the protagonist will be judged a glutton. In order to be judged fit for rebirth, the player must be judicious in their choices; take only what is necessary, help out others wherever possible, and do not cause undue suffering...",

        "description": "In the near future, household pests have become highly resistant to all kinds of chemical pesticides. Naturally, the answer to this plague is miniature customizable robots, programmed to hunt down and destroy household pests using miniaturized weapons. A lonely young man named Aburatsubo has just purchased Mars Pharmaceuticals' latest model, ID-3 HoiHoi-san, a cute 10cm pink-haired girl in a maid dress made to serve his every whim, just so long as that whim is to ruthlessly gun down cockroaches.\n\nIchigeki Sacch\u016b!! HoiHoi-san (\"One-Shot Extermination! HoiHoi-san\") is a third-person action shooting game based on the eponymous manga by Kunihiko Tanaka. The player takes direct control of HoiHoi-san in various mission-based stages. The goal of each stage is generally to defeat a certain number of pests, while avoiding their attacks and ensuring that HoiHoi-san's batteries remain charged. Two different weapons can be equipped at any given time, including both long-range firearms and short-range bladed weapons, among numerous others.\n\nAs stages are cleared, the player earns money which can be used to purchase new outfits and weapons for HoiHoi-san at the local drug store. An unusual feature of the game is an optional filter that obscures the appearance of the various pests, so even those who can't stand the sight of cockroaches can play!",

        "description": "Ico is a boy with horns. At the age of twelve, when his horns grew large enough, the elders send him away to be sacrificed in order to prevent evil spirits from attacking the village. Entombed in a crumbling ancient castle, Ico only manages to begin his escape when a freak earthquake shakes loose the vessel he has been locked in. Ico shortly meets a princess named Yorda, who has been imprisoned by the evil queen. The two children must explore the ominous castle, trying to find a way to escape, persecuted by the queen's shadow minions.\n\nICO is a third-person perspective game that mixes action-based exploration gameplay with puzzles. The game is set almost exclusively in the castle, which consists of dozens of rooms, passages, platforms, and contraptions. Ico will run, climb, and jump his way through these environments. The puzzles in the game are physical (environmental): Ico must push and pull objects, manipulate switches, re-arrange structures, etc.\n\nYorda will accompany Ico throughout most of the game. Many of the puzzles revolve around creating a way for Yorda to access special glowing blue doors, which only she is capable of unlocking with her powers. Being less athletic than Ico, Yorda will often need a more comfortable path built for her. Ico can hold Yorda's hand to lead her with him, and also call her to come nearer.\n\nWith the exception of the final (and only) boss, all the enemies in the game are shadows. They attack in groups, either at pre-set points, or when Ico is separated from Yorda for a long time. Their goal is always the same: to capture Yorda and carry her towards a black whirlpool. If the player fails to rescue her before she is consumed by this shadow portal, the game is over. Conversely, Ico can not be killed by the shadows; they can only push him, preventing him from reaching Yorda in time. The player must therefore fend off the shadows (Ico uses a stick for the largest portion of the game), at the same time hurrying towards Yorda. Protecting and rescuing Yorda is one of the primary gameplay elements in ICO.\n\nThe game has no HUD (heads-up display). Other distinguishing features are the soft lightning visual style, low-key use of in-game music, and conversations through a fictional language, leaving much to the player's imagination.",

She wrote it because of her appreciation of the game (ISBN 4-06-212441-6).\n\nVersion differences\n\nThe US version does not contain the second playthrough bonuses present in the Japanese and European releases. These include translated subtitles (initially hieroglyphs), the option to have a second player (who controls the princess), a secret weapon different from the one findable in the first playthrough, and the option to play the game with one of four cinematic video filters.

The objective here is to simply beat every one of the characters to become the number one driver. As players go along, they collect points, which can be used to upgrade the car.\n\nThe second mode, \"Story Mode\", allows the player to control Takumi, the protagonist of the series. In this mode, there are a number of missions the player must complete. These missions are modelled after the events of the manga and anime series. Most of the missions involve racing characters from the manga, in the same order that Takumi raced them in the original work.",

        "description": "Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.\n\nEven though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.\n\nDuring the quests players can collect trading cards to unlock mini-games. Other features include bricks to create \"Brickimals\" and the ability to change LEGO Island objects.",

        "description": "Itadaki Street 3 is, despite what the name might suggest, the fourth title in the long-running Itadaki Street series. In this Monopoly-inspired digital board game, players take turns moving around the board, which is divided into districts made up of multiple properties. Landing on a property allows you to buy it, and owning multiple properties in the same district increases their value, but landing on a property owned by another player forces you to pay them based on the property's value. There are also other types of spaces around the board: chance spaces let you draw a card with a random effect, transport spaces move you to distant locations, and the ever-useful bank gives you a bonus when you reach it.\n\nThis is the first title in the series to be presented in full 3D, including elaborate backgrounds for each map. There is also an in-depth tutorial mode to teach new players how the game works. In addition to the standard Free Play and Tournament modes, there are two new modes present: Training mode, where the player teaches a computer-controlled character by example, trying to train them to be a top player; and Itadaki Quest, which gives specific single-player objectives to complete on preset maps. There are more than 30 maps to play, including returning maps from previous titles.",

The two are split up, with Jak thrown into jail by Baron Praxis, the ruler of Haven City. For two years Jak is experimented on with dark Eco, turning him into an almost Hulk-like character, mean and filled with rage.\n\nRescued by Daxter, the two must set off and find a way to shut down the operation and get revenge for Jak's uncontrollable change. Along the way they will meet new friends and deadly enemies (known as Metal Heads), but at least now Jak has something special on his side: weapons, and lots of them. Including a shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun and a powerful blast weapon. Gameplay includes platforming, vehicle racing, rescue missions, hover boarding, playing mini games and shooting at various enemies (including boss fights).",

        "description": "Jet Ion GP is set in the year 2040, a time when petrol prices have risen as oil-wells start to run dry. The future of mankind lies in the new technology of Cold Fusion but this is being suppressed by the oil companies who are more powerful than governments. Pilot Jet Jevons leads a rebel faction who learn of this and they fight to give the power back to the governments. He does this by competing in high powered races around the world.\n\nJet Ion GP is a futuristic racing game for one or two players in which the player(s) pilot high speed aircraft around three dimensional courses avoiding obstacles and dodging enemy fire. All the courses are marked by a ribbon in the sky which the pilot needs to follow because that ribbon is what the craft draw power from. Straying too far from the ribbon means they lose speed, energy, and probably the race.\n\nBesides Jet Jevons there are other pilots and teams in the race and the player can fly as any of them. The game can be played in four modes:* The Grand Prix mode where the player must qualify for and then compete in a series of five races. Grand Prix' are competed in in five levels of difficulty, Standard, Expert B, Expert A, Master B, Master A, and Master S but only Standard is available at the beginning of the game and as the player progresses additional courses and craft are unlocked. As the player progresses through the race calendar additional vehicles become available, the courses become harder, and the races become longer.\n\nSingle Spot where the player qualifies for and competes in a single race.\n\nTime Attack where the player attempts to beat the track record for a course.\n\nVS which is the two player head-to-head game.",

The centerpiece is the so-called Success mode, where the player creates a single player and, starting in the minor leagues, trains them up into the majors and maybe even to the hall of fame. There is also a records mode that includes a database of all games from the 1999 season.\n\nThe game is fully-licensed by the NPB and includes player and team data through May 2000. The later-released \"Ketteiban\" is nearly identical but includes player data and match records through the end of the 2000 season.",

To win the board game, you must succeed at a variety of mini-games, which may include a wide variety of gameplay styles. Winning a mini-game earns you a party favor of a certain color. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most party favors to win. Party favors you win can then be used to unlock additional mini-games and bonus videos. If you unlock enough mini-games, you can then unlock a new game board in the main game.\n\nYou can choose to play as Gonzo, Animal, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Pepe, or Fonzie.

        "description": "Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis puts you in the shoes of a Dr. Hammond-type scientist, and challenges you to build a dinosaur themed amusement park.\n\nSimilar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences. Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs. While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping.\n\nYou have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths.\n\nYou can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie. You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it.\n\nOne of the most important objects is the Ranger Station. With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters. If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart. If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.\n\nIn order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed. The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be. Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.\n\nThe different dino's require different resources. Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows. Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.\n\nThe game includes multiple camera angles. You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter \"visitor\" cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.\n\nAlso included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.",

This time, there's a choice between American and Japanese mosquitoes, each attacking a family of its nationality.\n\nThe player controls the mosquito, flying around the room where the victim takes a rest. When approaching the human, the possible target areas on the body glow green. When the insect lands on those places, a small zoom screen shows the exposed skin and the mosquito ready to attack. Pressing the analog button makes the bug bite the victim, and moving the analog control fast starts the pumping action, where a syringe starts to slowly fill with blood. The danger of the human swatting the bug increases as the skin surrounding the bite gets more red.\n\nSometimes the human gets up and starts to search for the mosquito. Green beams shine forth from the eyes, and the player must maneuver the insect out of its reach. When engaging in battle mode, the mosquito must bite certain body parts to decrease the human stress shown at the bottom of the screen.",

He hears calls for help from a distant voice, and catches glimpses of a fantastic kingdom not of this world. One night, he comes home from work and finds a curious program on his laptop, which seems to be a simple picture-book creator. Intrigued, he starts it up, when suddenly a bright light envelopes him. When he awakens, he is in the strange land he saw in his dreams, surrounded by five beautiful young girls. They believe he is the savior that they have been waiting for, and without any way to return to his home, the man has no choice but to join them on their adventure.\n\nKanojo no Densetsu, Boku no Sekiban (Her Legend, My Picture) is a traditional Japanese-style visual novel. The player reads along as the story proceeds, occasionally making decisions which will lead to one of over 20 different endings. Somewhat anachronistically, the protagonist has access to his laptop, which he can use to review previous events, check his email, or fiddle with a variety of settings and other features.",

The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing. A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song. If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes.\n\nIf the player sings well, the crowd gets into the performance by clapping, cheering and dancing. If the performance is bad, the audience becomes bored and the user can get booed off the stage.\n\nSingle Player Game Modes include:\n\nMulti-player Game Mode include:\n\nOver 35 songs from the '70s, '80s, '90s, and current hits including (as made famous by):\n\n\"Addicted\" (Simple Plan), \"All You Wanted\" (Michelle Branch), \"Are You Happy Now?\" (Michelle Branch), \"Believe\" (Cher), \"Billie Jean\" (Michael Jackson), \"Bizarre Love Triangle\" (New Order), \"Broken Wings\" (Mr. Mister), \"Celebration\" (Kool and the Gang), \"Chain of Fools\" (Aretha Franklin), \"Complicated\" (Avril Lavigne), \"Crawling in the Dark\" (Hoobastank), \"Don't Know Why\" (Norah Jones), \"Every Morning\" (Sugar Ray), \"Everything You Want\" (Vertical Horizon), \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" (Cyndi Lauper), \"Hey Jealousy\" (The Gin Blossoms), \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\" (Pat Benatar), \"How You Remind Me\" (Nickelback), \"I'm Coming Out\" (Diana Ross), \"It's The End of the World As We Know It\" (REM), \"Kiss Me\" (Sixpence None the Richer), \"Ladies' Night\" (Kool and the Gang), \"Like a Virgin\" (Madonna), \"One Week\" (Barenaked Ladies), \"Red Red Wine\" (UB40), \"Save Tonite\" (Eagle Eye Cherry), \"Science Genius Girl\" (Freezepop), \"She Talks to Angels\" (Black Crowes), \"Smooth Criminal\" (Michael Jackson/Alien Ant Farm), \"Son of a Preacher Man\" (Dusty Springfield), \"The Power of Love\" (Huey Lewis and the News), \"Waiting for Tonight\" (Jennifer Lopez), \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" (Michael Bolton), \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" (Bette Midler), \"You Really Got Me\" (Van Halen), \"You're the One That I Want\" (Less Than Jake)\n\nPlayers can unlock extra characters, additional outfits, more songs, and behind the scenes videos.\n\nThe game includes an option for Expansion Discs - which means players will be able to karaoke to additional songs in the future.",

        "description": "Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf.\n\nGame Play Modes:\n\nInfinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf.\n\nHigh Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?\n\nIcon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.\n\nCareer Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.\n\nMultiplayer Modes:\n\nPush - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to \"push\" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.\n\nHead to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.\n\nTime Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.\n\nThe Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.\n\nThe beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.\n\nThe PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.",

Victory or defeat will steer you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional 'what if?' scenarios.\n\nBattles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes.\n\nBefore, after, and sometimes even during battles you'll be shown cut-scenes that depict the personal struggles of your various subordinates.",

        "description": "It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu.\n\nKessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc. The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.",

Instead she was used as a pawn to cause animosity between the tyrant, Dong Zhuo, and his great general, Lu Bu.\n\nAnother example of a radical change is the gender change of one of Cao Cao's most trusted generals, Xun Yu, from a male in the original written work, to a female in the game. This seems to be done to give Cao Cao and additional love interest.\n\nOther noticeable deviations include Asian characters with blonde hair and glasses on one 2nd century queen.\n\n More"

        "description": "Kimi ga Nozomu Eien is an adult visual novel in Japanese. The story revolves around the male high school student Takayuki Narumi. The game is divided into two chapters. The first one takes place between 6th July and 20th August 1998 and the second one is set three years later in 2001. The romantic story tells the relationship between Takayuki and Haruka Suzumiya, as they are set up on a date through friends. There is a dramatic incident and the consequences are then detailed in the second chapter.\n\nThe game follows a branching plot line through pre-determined scenarios with very limited player input. Most of the gameplay shows text along with character sprites against background art, but there are also sequences where CG artwork is used. All CG items are collected in a gallery available after completing the game for the first time. There are multiple endings based on a number of decisions. In total there are eight main plot lines to experience, based on the main eight female characters that can be encountered.\n\nThe original PC version is an adult version with sexual imagery. The Dreamcast and PS2 consumer ports do not contain the adult content.",

At the same time, there is turmoil in the Disney Castle. King Mickey is missing, and Court Wizard Donald and Captain Goofy are out to find him. On their travels they meet Sora, on his own search for his lost friends. The three are told of ominous creatures called Heartless, being without hearts derived from an unknown dimension and are the ones responsible for the devastating storm.\n\nThe Disney villains, enticed by the power of darkness, manipulate the Darkness to help them gather the princesses of heart, who are needed to open a mysterious final door. Upon discovering the link between the Heartless, the storm, and the disappearance of King Mickey, Sora, Donald, and Goofy join forces and help familiar Disney heroes to save their worlds from the Heartless.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts players step into the very large shoes of Sora, wielder of the keyblade. Sora can attack with the blade, and as he levels up he will gain more attacks that are automatically chained together. Sora can learn magic and put healing items into a quick menu, and both can only be used in real time. Donald and Goofy (as well as an additional character exclusive to each world/disney movie) will follow Sora. Their equipment and AI can be adjusted, but they can not be directly controlled. Defeated enemies will drop many kinds of items including synthesis materials. Sora can take these to the Synthesis shop in Twilight Town to turn them into usable items, accessories, and weapons.\n\nTraveling between each world requires Sora's party to fly through space in a Gummi Ship. The Gummi Ship can be completely customized, from speed and armor to weapons and shape, out of parts picked up from destroyed Gummi Ships, found in worlds, or bought from a store. Larger, more complex ships can be built as the game progresses, and plans can be found from destroyed enemies or from an NPC that will automatically build a Gummi Ship of specific specifications.",

        "description": "Many years ago, a powerful talisman known as Idol of Sorrow turned the ancient Holy Land, the home of the Forest Folk, into the cursed Land of Disaster. The idol's evil powers once again awakened when the king of Heladin mistook it for a symbol of peace. One day, Prince Devian of Azalin Empire is visited by a mysterious stranger. The stranger hands him the Idol of Sorrow, and before long Devian realizes that he has been entrusted with the difficult task of taking the idol back to the Land of Disaster and finding a way to remove the curse.\n\nThe Ancient City is a first-person action role-playing game and the fourth entry in the King's Field series. Its core gameplay mechanics are similar to those of the predecessors: the player must explore vast interconnected areas and fight hostile creatures and weapons and magic. There are four types of weapons in the game: swords, clubs, axes, and bows. Repeatedly attacking with the same weapon raises its level, eventually allowing more powerful attacks with it. Magic is handled in a similar way, with spells increasing in power and raising Devian's magic points when used. Weapons and armor slowly deteriorate, but a blacksmith can repair them. Like in the previous games, every NPC can be attacked and killed. As opposed to the predecessors, the protagonist can swim underwater for a limited amount of time.",

By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa's magic ring...\n\nKlonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or 'Vision'), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the \"Dream Spirit\", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.\n\nBut what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.",

Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul.\n\nKya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.\n\nYou'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).\n\nAs you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!",

It could perhaps be stated that Kya is the only significant female character.\nThere are 260 wolfen that Kya can turn back into nativs, and yet you only meet around 20 or less nativs in nativ city, in the entire game.\nWeapons\n\nIn the anime Naruto, the character called Tenten is a weapons expert. In episode 43, Tenten takes out a scroll full of weapons and shoots an array of different weapons at an enemy. Two of the weapons resemble Kya's boomy, except they were both metal and one did not have a handle, even though she does in fact throw two weapons similar to Kya's boomy it is just coincidence.The insane number of weapons Tenten uses (as well as the variety of them) means that the weapons mentioned couldn't possibly be like that on purpose. Additionally, the release schedule makes it likely that it's just random coincidence.\n\n More"

Recalling what she can of the past few hours, she remembers walking in on a killer after discovering the body of Von Croy, her friend and former mentor. She must make a hasty escape from the authorities who blame her for the crime. Determined to discover the fiend responsible, Lara eventually uncovers an evil plot that could cause the destruction of mankind. If the reincarnation of the \"angel of darkness\" is allowed to happen, the world is doomed!\n\nThe game environment is set in the somewhat distant future. You'll lead Lara mostly in 3rd person perspective, travelling to various locales in Europe. Explore sewers, cemeteries, warehouses, factories and cities. A multitude of NPCs will be encountered, both in the form of friend as well as foe.\n\nAngel of Darkness introduces new stealth and close-combat moves - ducking, sneaking and hug-the-walls walking. Lara must build her skills by performing action sequences. You'll have her running, dodging, performing flying leaps and platform jumps, shimming along walls and cables, as well as moving boxes and other obstacles around. Advancements are achieved with strategically placed power-ups. Collect weapons and ammunition, artifacts and money.\n\nYou'll also play Kurtis Trent, a new male counterpart, for several \"levels\". Although Kurtis gets in Lara's way when she first meets him, he eventually becomes an ally when they realize they are both working towards the same goal.",

        "description": "Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world.\n\nThe game features 5 different game modes: Arcade. where the player competes freely on any of available tracks, Tour de France, where the player aims to win the prestigious competition in five years, by training and winning enough money to afford better bike parts and training sessions, Time Trial (racing against the clock) and train basic skills.\n\nAs the player is controlling a bike, it isn't just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won't immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar.\n\nIt was followed by Tour de France: Centenary Edition.",

        "description": "While games of the Pro Cycling Manager series attempt to recreate the feeling of being a Pro/Continental Tour cycling team manager, Tour de France: Centenary Edition is all about providing the thrills of being a cyclist, starting from the end of the peloton and making way to get a chance at victory. The game is licensed by the Tour de France, and features many real teams and cyclists in six stages, some of which available in reverse mode. Due to the nature of the name, this changes drastically the nature of the tracks - what can be a perfect track for climbers becomes one for the technical riders (with good breaking and turning abilities) in reverse.\n\nWhile the game provides a much simplified arcade experience, it plays a lot differently from games featuring motor vehicles. The player has a limited stamina bar, which decreases as the player goes faster to break away from the current group or pedals harder to beat a steeper hill. In order to replenish it, he can drink a limited number of water-bottles, use down slope sections or, the key to a successful stage, use opponents' and team-mates slipstreams. However, this is not all without risks - down slope sections can be tricky due to the enormous speeds, and colliding takes stamina as well as time (and eventually, might force a retirement), and slipstreams are not always available or big enough. As cycling is also a team sport, the player can request a team-mate to slipstream him during a break, or to give him additional water bottles. They are also easier to slipstream, as they won't break away if the player close too long. Also playing a huge part on the race is the weather - rain makes pedalling much harder and increase the breaking distance noticeably, while fog reduces stamina loss, but players must be careful not to overdo speed due to limited viewing distance.\n\nGame modes include training, arcade, time trials and the Tour de France, a career mode where the player can start a 5-year plan to become the world's number one cyclist by winning local races, which allows to afford better bike parts and training sessions. Parts affect mostly how well the player controls the bike, but as the game simulates the stage until the final miles, the starting position in the peloton is defined by the training, so a player who has a top bike but neglected training will struggle to perform well in the Tour de France, as instead of starting in the top 40 will start in 80th or even worse, losing precious time and both sprint and mountain points in the process.",

        "description": "Following the events of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, Raziel and Kain were trapped in the Serafan fortress. Separated by sudden events, Raziel was forced to retreat into the spectral realm, leaving Kain to escape from the Serafan on his own. Both must escape the predicament they find themselves in and fight back against those who would seek to use them as manipulations in a grander plot. From both heroes cry out shouts of defiance, and a thirst to find the revelations that have been buried in the world of Nosgoth.\n\nLegacy of Kain: Defiance is a third-person action game with light puzzle-solving elements, combining concepts seen in both Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2. The story unfolds through chapters, focusing alternately on Kain and Raziel as they pursue their separate, though intertwined quests. Control of each character alternates between levels, however both are controlled from a behind-the-shoulder perspective. While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities.\n\nKain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be \"charged\" to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures, Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance.\n\nThe two are, however, different characters that play differently, each requiring use of his talents, to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers.",

Mobius urges Raziel to continue his quest for revenge and destroy the vampire lord Kain. Raziel reluctantly agrees and heads off to discover the knowledge and weapons that will allow him to achieve his goal.\n\nSoul Reaver 2 is a third-person action game with puzzle-solving and some platforming elements, similar to the previous installment. The game world is viewed from behind Raziel's shoulder; the player can move him in any direction, climb, attack, swim, jump and use specific abilities. Raziel retains his special moves from the previous game, which include gripping onto the sides of ledges, climbing walls, and gliding downwards with his torn wings. Like in the previous installment, Raziel can travel between the material world and the spectral realm at will, gaining access to new areas by exploiting distortions that exist between the mirrored worlds. As before, he must drain the souls of his enemies to prolong his existence in the material realm.\n\nRaziel no longer gains abilities from absorbing great souls and instead must imbue his Soul Reaver weapon by activating certain elemental temples. Once activated, various \"elemental fonts\" can be used to charge the Soul Reaver to specific attributes. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of other weapons including daggers, swords, axes, spears as well as the Soul Reaver and bare-handed claws.\n\nUnlike the previous game, Soul Reaver 2 is linear and follows specific paths through different areas. Raziel cannot return to certain areas once he has left them behind. The game features diverse puzzles, often involving blocks or manipulation of different devices. One common theme is \"light puzzles\" where Raziel must reflect light, using mirrored objects, so that they touch switches or objects which require activation.",

An early preview of the game, suggests this was the intention.\nThe Water, Earth and Spirit Elemental Reavers were meant to be included in this game, they were not finished in time. Their symbols can be seen in the Elder God's Chamber along with Fire, Air, Light and Darkness.\nApparently, the Spirit Reaver was meant to have a Hookshot-like ability.\nIn the \"Making of\" material section, the Enemy subsection included artwork of Vampires that were meant to be encountered ingame. However they were cut from the final release, and the only Vampires are either main characters or the strung-up kills of the mercenary and Sarafan Armies. Apparently, there were two parts where Raziel would have met them. Firstly, there was a planned sequence involving Raziel interrupting a slaying. And secondly, there was to be a hidden vampire village in the swamp ruins. It's not known whether or not they would have been allies or enemies. There were vampiric and/or demonic cultists planned to appear but they were also dropped. Actually, the lack of vampiric opponents is a surprising turn of events considering that mutated and devolved vampires made up the bulk of the enemies in Soul Reaver.\nReferences: Series\nWhen Moebius stands in confrontation with Malek at his side, faint screams can be heard in the background. The screams and dialog match the introduction to the first Blood Omen game, implying that events are occurring at the same time.\nWhen Raziel enters the 'full circle' room for the first time (the room with the snake on the ground), in Moebius' crusade era, there are paintings on the wall depicting the Sarafan warriors and a statue of Raziel himself. Well, if you look at Rahab's picture, you'll see a couple of seahorses carved in his armor. Funny thing, since Rahab will be the first vampire with the ability to swim in Soul Reaver...\nReferences\n\nAlthough the game was released before the movie Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, there's a reference to it, or at least a big coincidence.\n\nWhen Raziel is heading back to the Serafan Stronghold, after Janos Audron's death, as he reaches the pillars, 3 demons block his way. These demons are very similar to the Balrog in LOTR, but without wings. One of them turn to Raziel and say \"You shall not pass!\", just like Gandalf says to Balrog in the movie!\n\nTitle screen\n\nThe background image that swirls around during the title screen is actually the Tomb of William the Just, the view shifts between the material realm and the spectral realm.\n\nInformation also contributed by chiriniea, Mark Ennis and WildKard\n\n More"

        "description": "A group of people known as Mystics live like outcasts, shunned by most humans because of their unique connection to the world of spirits: they are able to summon powerful supernatural beings called Origins. A small village of Nohl is a refuge for Mystics; one of them is a young swordsman named Lang, whose duty is to protect a crystal that supplies the town with water. One day, Lang meets a mysterious man who manipulates him into giving up the crystal. Determined to correct his mistake, Lang sets on a journey to retrieve the crystal, on which he will learn more of the role the Mystics and their Origins play in the world.\n\nLegaia 2: Duel Saga is a follow-up to Legend of Legaia, though it is not directly connected to it story-wise, featuring a different cast of characters. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. The game utilizes a system called \"Arts\", which requires the player to press a combination of buttons corresponding to fighting moves during battles. These are divided into the sub-categories \"Normal Arts\" (basic moves), \"Hyper Arts\" (more powerful moves that require special points to be spent), \"Mystic Arts\" (Origin powers), and, finally, \"Variable Arts\" (team attacks).\n\nThe game also features a Camping mode; accessing it, the player is able to communicate with the characters in the party, prepare meals from ingredients, and craft items such as weapons, armor, and accessories.",

Guide her well, and she may be able to rescue you. Rely on her, for she is your one and only life line.\n\nLifeline is the first game on the PlayStation 2 that is entirely voice controlled. You do not directly control Rio. Instead, you speak to her and tell her what to do. If you want her to open the bathroom door, tell her to open the bathroom door. If there is a keycard laying on the table, tell her to pick it up. If a monster is closing in that she can't shoot, tell her to run away. You explore the entire Space Station Hotel, from the kitchen to maintenance to bedrooms to bathrooms, finding items and encountering a slew of different enemies.\n\nThe game recognizes over two thousand words and phrases. Commands generally consists of a noun and a verb, but many of those can be combined into a single command (e.g. reload, shoot, retreat). Rio can also be ordered to target specific parts of enemies to exploit their weaknesses and players can also change the attack order in a similar fashion.\n\nA headset is required to play the game, from a game bundle, a third-party headset, or any headset compatible with USB.",

Regardless of game mode, managers have access to detailed tactics and training settings, allowing you to work on players' weaknesses and build on their strengths.\n\nThe PS2 version lets you watch the full match in 3D, and both versions have a comprehensive highlights section, voiced on PS2 by real-life BBC analysts Gary Lineker and Alan Hansen.",

        "description": "London Racer II is another iteration in the prolific Racer series by Davilex. The races take place primarily in the streets of London and Edinburgh, with additional tracks in Las Vegas, New York and Chicago.\n\nThere are three single player modes available: Single Race, Tournament and Time Trial. In Single Race, the player is free to choose any of the 6 characters available, any of the tracks and any of the unlocked cars. In Tournament mode, the player races in a series of tracks while collecting money prizes and unlocking new cars. In both modes, players race against other racers while avoiding being caught by the police. In the Time Trial mode, players race against the clock trying to beat the best time for each track.\n\nEach car (driven by a different character) has different stats in acceleration, top speed, handling, breaking and strength. The cars can also be upgraded using money collected from winning races and collecting money tokens during races. The cars also take damage when hit and can break into total loss if the damage bar is full. Repair tokens can be collected during races and if a car finishes a race damaged, it can be repaired before the next one using money. Nitro tokens can also be collected and bought, and the cars' colors can be changed.\n\nThere are also two split-screen two player modes: Duel and Cop vs. Driver. In the Duel mode, players race against each other in any given track. In Cop vs. Driver, one player is the cop and the other a regular racer, and the cop player must try to crash the driver within the time limit.\n\nThe game can be played from either first (hood camera) or third person (behind the car) perspective.",

        "description": "Love Smash! 5 is a sequel to the budget tennis game Love Smash!. Once again, a secret underground organization has brought together the world's greatest tennis players, though this time they all happen to be attractive young women. In addition to the story mode, there is also an Exhibition mode for one or two players. While the game plays quite similarly to the original title, the option to play Doubles has been removed.\n\nThis sequel brings the total character count to 12, including two secret characters, each with their own stats and special moves. There are four different courts, all of them highly-unorthodox. There is a specific focus on the female characters, as each has multiple unlockable outfits and full CG ending movies. There is also a \"photo gallery\" that includes images of each character, and a model viewer where each character's animations can be viewed from any angle.\n\nThe game was re-released in 2005 as Love Smash! 5.1 as part of the Simple 2000 Ultimate series. This version features updated character models and minor gameplay tweaks, but is otherwise identical.",

This version comes with an all-new graphics and physics engine, its own selection of modes and teams, and several unique features.\n\nBesides highly detailed players, the new graphics engine for the first time offers such visual elements as players sitting on the bench, coaches walking the sidelines, line judges dropping their markers, grass sticking to players' helmets and rain drop splashes. Movement is now momentum-based, with players' height and weight taken into account upon running and changing direction, and hit location and speed determining how the tackle plays out.\n\nGameplay modes include a selection of those available on other platforms and include exhibition games, season, franchise and practice. A new mode is Quick Play which sets up a quick random game. For beginners, the game includes an Easy Play mode which simplifies the playbook, makes passes easier and auto-assists on running and receiving.\n\nThe game includes a large number of teams, second only to the PC version: the 31 regular teams of the 2000 NFL season, the 1999 All-Madden team, 31 all-time franchise teams, the 6 NFL Europe teams plus 124 classic NFL teams.\n\nThe game also includes the Madden Cards mode seen in the previous generation's version, even though the challenges differ slightly: by completing certain objectives in the game, players gain tokens that can be used to buy collectible Madden Cards. These cards offer upgrades of players' stats, unlock classic players as well as hidden teams and stadiums and can trigger various gameplay cheats and gags.",

        "description": "Amakusa Shir\u014d, leader of the Shimabara Rebellion, was put to death by the Tokugawa Shogunate. However, in his final moments, he renounced his god, and has been resurrected as a demon, bent on destroying the Tokugawa Shogunate and all who support it. To this end, he has brought back several warlords and swordsmen of his time, serving his every whim. Yagy\u016b J\u016bbei, a gifted young swordsman, scarcely escapes Shir\u014d's attempt on his life. Discovering that his sister has been kidnapped, he sets out to put an end to Shir\u014d's plans.\n\nMakai Tensh\u014d is an dungeon-crawler RPG based on the 1967 novel of the same title by F\u016btar\u014d Yamada. Similar to Chunsoft's Mysterious Dungeon series, the player controls the hero Yagy\u016b J\u016bbei through randomly-generated floors, which are filled with enemies, items, and traps, searching for the exit and attempting to survive. Movement and actions are turn-based, with all enemies taking a turn at the same time as the player. Weapons will degrade with use, though new ones of varying types can be found within the dungeons. After clearing a certain number of floors, the player reaches a village, where they may rest and save.",

By using Maken's mental powers, the hero can transform into other characters, and it is up to him to decide which side he will join in the conflict.\n\nThis version has updated graphics, and switches the perspective to third-person.

The remake contains much more mythological background information than the original. Myths about Pan Gu, the cosmic human who separated the earth from the sky, and about ba gua (hakke in Japanese pronunciation), the \"eight hexagrams\" (taken from the classic Chinese book Yi Jing) play a central role in the game. Some myths are freely interpreted or significantly changed, like the myth about tai ji (called Tai Chi in the game), the original matter from which the world was created. In the game, Tai Chi is a person with an own will."

        "description": "Manhunt casts you as James Earl Cash, a prisoner on death row. You are led down a corridor where you are about to receive a lethal injection. The needle goes in. You wake up hours later. A mysterious voice tells you to stick in the nearby earpiece, and explains that the \"lethal\" injection was just a heavy sedative. The man, later identified as Starkweather, turns out to be a director of snuff movies, where the people are really killed. He explains that if you follow his directions, manage to kill people and survive, you'll earn your freedom. This begins James Earl Cash's journey.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, you'll have to make your way through different locales, such as a city and a mall, while killing gangs. You'll face lots of different gangs, from The Hoods and The Skins to tougher gangs like The Innocenz. Gang members carry weapons ranging from pistols and shotguns to knives and glass shards.\n\nManhunt is primarily a stealth game. You'll have to hide behind walls, flatten yourself against walls, crouch, hide behind objects, and walk to avoid attracting attention. You can also throw glass bottles to create a distraction, or you can punch surfaces and yell to get gangs to come to you.\n\nYou have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from the traditional, such as the shotgun and uzi, to the disgusting, such as a sickle and plastic bag. Each weapon has three different ways of attacking, depending on how long you hold the button. A quick attack will do the job, a medium attack will be bloody, but a high attack, requiring the longest amount of time, will earn you the most points, and will allow you to see your kill in a cinematic style, with blood splatting on the camera, and gurgling noises.\n\nManhunt also lets you use a USB headset, such as the one that came included with SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals. With the headset, you will hear Starkweather speak into your ears instead of through your speakers, and you will be able to shout into the microphone to attract gangs instead of pressing a button.",

Computer games with this rating are not suitable for anyone under 15 years old. The following year, the game was blamed for the death of a British teenager. Due to this, the censors met to review the game's rating on September 29. After this, the game's rating immediately changed from MA15+ to RC, meaning that it is illegal for anyone to purchase Manhunt, or import it into Australia.\n\nIn Ontario, Canada, the game was on February 3, 2004 the first ever to be slapped with a mandatory R rating (restricted to be bought or rented by those only of age 18 or older). It was applied by the Ontario Film Review Board, an agency of the Ministry of Consumer and Business Services, after its panel reviewed the game in part because of complaints by parents.\n\nGerman index\n\nOn March 31, 2004, Manhunt (PS2) was put on the infamous German index by the BPjM. Both Windows and Xbox versions followed February 26, 2005.\n\nFor more information about what this means and to see a list of games sharing the same fate, take a look here: BPjS/BPjM indexed games.\n\nIn addition to the indexing, on July 19, 2004, the PlayStation 2 version was also confiscated for violating \u00a7131 of Germany's penal code (for showing cruel violence against humans etc.). Both Windows and Xbox versions followed July 21, 2005.\n\nReferences\n\nThe game takes place in Carcer City, which is the city right next door to Liberty City, the locale of Grand Theft Auto III, and was also mentioned numerous times in that game.\n\nOriginal build differences\n\nIn the original build of the game, the scene \"Kill the Rabbit\" was originally titled \"Pool of Tears\".\n\nInformation also contributed by ~~, CaptainCanuck, *Katakis*, Martin Smith, Scaryfun, and Xoleras\n\n More"

Each of the more than two-dozen characters have their own set of moves available.\n\nThere are a number of different modes available. There is a battle mode for one or two players, which comes in two different variants. There is also a story mode where Crea sets out to find a missing piece of Kururu's puzzle, and must defeat a variety of other characters at jigsaw battles to do so. There is of course also a solo mode where any puzzle can be freely played with a variety of options. Last, there is a museum mode, where high-resolution images of any cleared puzzle can be viewed.",

        "description": "Mat \"The Condor\" Hoffman and nine other world-class Pro BMX riders feature in this entry to the BMX racing series. Many gameplay features remain as before.\n\nWith the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.\n\nSingle Player Modes: Session - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.\n\nFree Ride - Like Session, you can use this mode to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Since any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick, no scores can be saved.\n\nRoad Trip - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Within each level, there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.\n\nMultiplayer Modes: Trick Attack - Compete against each other in a split screen competition to get the highest score you can in a certain amount of time.\n\nFree Ride - Ride around showing off your stuff to your opponent.\n\nGraffiti War - Ride around and find the Spray Cans in the level. Once you find them, perform a trick on the terrain. Once a stunt is completed, your opponent's screen will be \"painted\". The opponent can perform a higher scoring trick to clear the paint.\n\nTag - The person that is \"it\" is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you're it, score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.\n\nH.O.R.S.E. - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.\n\nTreasure Hunt - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.\n\nHalf Pipe Hell - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.\n\nPush - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent's screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets pushed all the way off the screen.\n\nThe Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.\n\nThe locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.\n\nTo enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in.\n\nExclusive to the XBox version, you get to be able to ride in London, UK and have an extra rider - Chad Kagy.",

        "description": "Max Payne was a police officer of the New York City police. On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.\n\nMax Payne is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, \"hardboiled\" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called Bullet Time - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first Matrix movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.\n\nCutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\n1001 Video Games\n\nThe PC version of Max Payne appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn England, the game was advertised on hydrants covered with actual yellow police lines with the game's name and slogan on it (\"Max Payne - A Man With Nothing to Lose\" etc...), just like the game box's cover art.\n\nBullet time\n\nThe origins of bullet time, made famous in the movie The Matrix and as a playable effect in Max Payne, are attributed to Eadweard Muybridge (April 9, 1830 \u2013 May 8, 1904), who used still cameras placed along a racetrack to take pictures of a galloping horse.\n\nCancelled Dreamcast version\n\nMax Payne was initially in development for the Dreamcast up to the point that Remedy demoed the game at E3 in 1998. Despite some more refined character models, the game looks and plays almost identically to the PS2 and Xbox versions of the game.\n\nDevelopment\nEarly on the V drug was not only a mind-warping drug, but also body-warping. It fact it made its users grow into hulking giants with glowing green eyes. In fact, early script drafts deal with super soldiers. There were even work in progress screenshots which shows Max fighting these super soldiers. All this was scrapped as it looked silly and was too similar to Sin.\nIn order to create the game, the developers from Remedy traveled from Finland to New York to photograph the buildings and streets. You can read about their adventure at the 3D Realms website: http://www.3drealms.com/max/newyork.html\nGerman index\n\nThis game was put on the German index on 29.09.2001. A short time afterwards, according to a Take 2 salesman, the planned to publish a \"toned down\" version of Max Payne. It would be cut so it could get a \"12+\" rating and they wanted to do a German translation including voiceovers. This would allow them to sell it again since it isn't the same as the banned game and even more, it's localized so more people could enjoy it.\n\nThe new box art had a yellow \"police line\" over or under the MAX PAYNE title on the box which stated it was a toned down version. However, this version got canned.\n\nThe ban on the game was eventually lifted.\n\nInaccuracies\n\nDespite all the \"realism\" put into the game... The \"code numbers\" given by NYPD officers are completely wrong, according to an ex-NYPD officer (Rich Laporte of gonegold.com)\n\nMusic\n\nThe music for the game was made by K\u00e4rtsy Hatakka, who is also the singer and bass player for a band called Waltari.\n\nReferences\nThe game features some humourous moments. In one of the earlier levels, there is a room off one of the ledges outside a building. Inside is a guy lying on the ground with a stake in his back, and the letters \"BUFF\" (with obvious reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer) scrawled in blood next to him. Max passes a comment along the lines off \"I don't even want to know what happened here.\"\nIn another level, you need a password to get into a laundry room. After finding a low-life to help you out, stand off to the side while he tries to get you in. He's given a first name and asked to give the full name before they'll open the door. The name he has to give is \"John Woo\", director and king of slow-motion action sequences in movies, an obvious inspiration for the developers of Max Payne.\nAt one point in the game, Max comes across a television show speaking about the Aesir Corporation, and how they are becoming another monopoly like Microsoft. However, because Microsoft is a copyrighted name, the television gives a bit of static when Microsoft is spoken, and the graphic novel displays \"*static*\" instead of Microsoft.\nThe Dopefish (an enemy from Commander Keen 4, the Dopefish is usually put into games as an easter egg) appears in Max Payne.\nIn the room immediately after Alfred Woden's office, if you shoot a picture off the wall, you'll find a switch. Pressing it will open a secret passage to a room with a Star Trek parody.\nAt some point you will pass by a TV in which the images show a familiar red-curtained room and a flamingo, and the accompanying dialog is all in Twin Peaks style. The music has that hip TP jazzy sound. A man's voice talks about his \"evil twin,\" which of course ties in with the dopplegangers of Twin Peaks. The flamingo's speaking style sounds much like the Little Man in Twin Peaks dream sequences. The flamingo may be a reference to Wild Palms, which included flamingos and is sometimes compared to Twin Peaks. Elsewhere, another TV shows a soap opera with events that closely parallel events in the game; this 'soap opera device' was used often on Twin Peaks. During the Twin Peaks parody portion, the flamingo\u2019s speech is distorted and it is impossible to understand what it\u2019s saying except its final line: \u201cThe Flesh of Fallen Angels\u201d, a sort of recurrent motif along the game.\nOf all the various pop culture references found throughout the game, there is one that probably escapes the notice of most players. In the tutorial level, take a look at the Tar Cafe signs. Their address is listed as \"604 All Your Base Are\", a reference to the poorly-translated intro of Zero Wing.\nIn the Ragnarock club there are references to the supernatural horror literature of H. P. Lovecraft - the so called Cthulhu Mythos. One of Jack Lupino's books is titled Necronomicon, and one of his personal \"spells\" mention the name \"Cthulhu\" as one of the dark gods that he invokes.\nIn Part I, Chapter Six, Max Payne enters a small flat. There is a gun lying on the counter, and a gangster can be heard whistling in the toilet. The toilet doors are locked tight, unless the player picks up the gun, which makes the adversary flush the toilet and come out. This is a reference to Quentin Tarantino's cult movie Pulp Fiction: (Pulp Fiction spoiler) This area closely resembles the scene of Vincent Vega's death, when Butch sneaks into his apartment and shoots Vic with his own gun which he left on the counter in the kitchen.\nIn the first level, Roscoe Street Station, Max overhears two thugs talking. After a moment of conversation or two, a phone rings. The ring tone is The Ecstasy of Gold from the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, composed by Ennio Morricone.\nReferences: Self\nIn the skyscraper mission, in one of the elevators, if you stay and listen, you will hear some guards talking about how it would be cool if you could see your moves in slow motion. The guard concludes by saying that he will name this effect Bullet-Time.\nIn one part of Max Payne, the graphic novel jokes about Max being a game (this happens in one of the nightmare sequences).\nAnother humorous moment... In Part 1, Chapter 2 \"Live from the Crime Scene\", you finally made your way into the bank vault, and the alarm is blaring. If you shoot the alarm (thus silencing it), Max will thank you.. The same happens at one point in the hotel: you must ride an elevator playing some cheesy elevator music. Shoot out the speaker and Max will thank you.\nMax Payne features a lot of Remedy employees as characters in the game, including screenwriter Sam Lake as Max Payne himself. This led to a very weird E3 2001 showing of the game, since Sam Lake was at GOD Games\u00b4 Promised Lot along other members of Remedy with a demo. Everybody was a bit disoriented by seeing Max Payne on screen and his real-life counterpart talking about the title right next to it.\nIn Part 1, Chapter 6, when you're chasing Vinnie, there is a billboard for Captain Baseball-Bat Boy, the comics you see throughout the game.\nVersion differences\n\nThe PS2 version doesn't allow you to quick save during a level unlike the PC and Xbox versions.\n\nAwards\nGamespy\n2001 - PC Action Game of the Year (Readers' Vote))\n2001 - Best Gimmick of the Year (for bullet time)\nPC Gamer\nApril 2005 - #41 in the \"50 Best Games of All Time\" list\n\nInformation also contributed by AkibaTechno, Archagon, DarkBubble, dasfatso, David Sky, Dreamweaver, Dr. M. \"Schadenfreude\" Von Katze, Erik Niklas, festershinetop, Juan Pablo Bouquet, Juguryo, JPaterson, Karthik KANE, Kasey Chang, MasterMegid, PCGamer77, phlux, Samuel James Vince and Scott Monster\n\n More"

        "description": "Two years have passed since Max Payne first embarked on his desperate quest for revenge. Returning to his former position as a detective in the New York City Police Department, Max is assigned to investigate a series of murders carried out by group of contract killers known as the Cleaners. Unexpectedly, Max encounters the enigmatic Mona Sax, whom he assumed dead. People from his past begin to return one by one, and Max gradually realizes that he did not know everything about the mysterious Circle and those who were involved in the murder of his family. Somebody out there is trying to kill Max, and he must find the answers before they succeed.\n\nMax Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a direct sequel to Max Payne. The game is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay concept and presentation, bringing back noir detective atmosphere, cinematic John Woo-style action, and cutscenes shaped like comic book panels.\n\nThe game is built on the same engine as the predecessor, with several additional special effects and enhancements, such as dynamic shadows and lighting, cubic mapped reflections, and high resolution textures. The Havok engine with ragdoll physics is used to enhance the interactivity with the game world: objects can be moved and destroyed, physically responding to the actions of the player character and opponents.\n\nA new feature in the sequel is the possibility to use secondary weapons alongside regulars guns, namely melee strikes, grenades and Molotov cocktails. Certain characters will join Max and fight on his side from time to time. The player also controls Mona Sax during a few stages. The Bullet Time feature from the previous game has been upgraded to version 2.0, in which Max's speed in bullet time increases as he gets more kills consecutively.\n\nDuring the first playthrough the game only offers one difficulty level. If the player struggles to succeed, the game will automatically lower the difficulty, reducing the effectiveness of enemy fire and increasing the amount of painkillers. Additional difficulty levels are unlocked when the player completes the game, as well as two new modes: New York Minute and Dead Man Walking. The first awards the player with a score for completing a level as quickly as possible, while the second has Max fighting endlessly respawning enemies.",

The cops are modeled and named after 3D Realms leads and co-founders George Broussard and Scott Miller. Pay attention to their dialogue; it makes fun out of the long production time of Duke Nukem Forever, ending with 3D Realms' legendary release date slogan (\"When it's done!\").\nIn the level \"Dearest of All My Friends\", Max and Vinnie escape in a delivery van which has the word \"Deliverator\" written on its side. According to Joe Siegler, it's a reference to Remedy's earlier racing game Death Rally, where \"Deliverator\" is the most powerful car in the game.\nReferences to the game\n\nMay Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne was parodied in an episode of \"Die Redaktion\" (The Editorial Team), a monthly comedy video produced by the German gaming magazine GameStar. It was published on the DVD of issue 06/2007.\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Story of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Graphics of the Year\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Successor of the Year\nGameSpy\n2003 \u2013 #8 PC Game of the Year\nGameStar (Germany)\nFebruary 13, 2004 - Best PC Action Game in 2003 (Readers' Vote)\nIssue 12/2008 - One of the \"10 Coolest Levels\" (For \"A Linear Sequence of Scares\".

Not only is the countryside filled with hordes of the roaming undead, but the four wise (and beautiful) sorceresses have been imprisoned at the four corners of the kingdom, and to make matters worse, your girlfriend, Princess Sophia, has been forced to marry the scoundrel Achille. Help Maximo rescue the sorceresses, restore good to the kingdom and get your girl back.\n\nMaximo: Ghosts to Glory is a 3D action game with an emphasis on combat. Maximo fights using his sword and shield, which can be upgraded and used in various combinations, inflicting damage on different types of enemies. His health is measured by the strength of his armor; once it is broken, Maximo will die from one hit. Coins can be collected and paid in order to ensure the possibility to continue playing the game following Maximo's death.",

However, they find out that one minecrawler in Canada still hasn't been destroyed. Kurt is sent to complete the mission, but as a result, gets kidnapped by an alien being known as Shwang Shwing. Doc and Max rush to his rescue and soon realize that they are up against a much bigger threat, involving an alien empire and galactic conquest. The fate of the Earth is in their hands.\n\nMDK 2 is the sequel to the third-person shooter MDK, largely following the same gameplay template and re-creating its humorous tone. Most of the gadgets used by Kurt in the previous game return in the sequel. In addition to levels in which the player controls Kurt, the game introduces two new playable characters, Doc and Max, with their own levels. The three protagonists have distinctly different gameplay styles. Kurt is a versatile fighter who is able to shoot enemies from afar using his trusty sniper mortal; the boss encounters of his levels usually involve various sniping strategies. Kurt can also use his special suit to glide from platform to platform. Max is the most straightforward of the three; having six legs, he can shoot from four guns at once, and also use a jetpack for long jumps. The Doc is physically the weakest character; he relies on stealth and manipulation of items to solve problems. He is able to fight using an atomic toaster, and can also consume plutonium, which transforms him into a monster for a short duration.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version as well as the later Wii version based on the PS2 version introduce different difficulty levels absent in the other versions.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nEnigma machine\n\nDuring the second mission of chapter two, \"Storm in the Port\", you are on a German U-Boat and have to steal any information you can and sabotage the boat. However, the level contains a bonus objective that is not told to you by the game. You can find a German Enigma Machine, and by pressing the action button can take the machine's codes and complete the bonus objective, and earn a medal for the action.\n\nThe German Enigma coding machine was not fictitious. It was in fact real. The Enigma was an encryption and cipher machine that the Germans used most famously in WWII. The system of encryption for the Enigma was extremely complex, and only through operator error, procedural error, or captured codebooks (a.k.a cipher) could the Allies decipher the messages. As a result, the Enigma's codebooks and secrets were extremely well-guarded. The simple fact that you can walk up to the machine and steal the codebook is questionable in the game, though such a feat certainly would have been awarded.\n\nThere is also the matter of historical accuracy. During WWII, only 15 cipher books had been captured, and the Americans and Canadians had one each. The rest were performed by the British. As well, the Naval Enigma cipher was actually captured by a British boarding crew on the U-110, not a single American soldier.\n\nBesides the historical background, the little objective is also a reference to the WWII movie U-571. The plot of the movie details an American naval crew attempting to capture the Naval Enigma cipher aboard the U-Boat U-571. This movie is also just as historically inaccurate as the game, which suggests, perhaps, that it was even the basis for which the objective was based on.\n\nAnother funny reference is that in the cheat menu, the typewriter you enter in cheats on is actually the Enigma itself.\n\nGerman version\n\nIn Germany the game had to be pulled from the shelves and all the covers had to be reprinted, because there was a swastika on the back cover and Nazi symbols aren't allowed in (or on) games there. For the same reason all Nazi flags in the game were replaced. Additionally all level statistics (except time and overall evaluation) were removed, the cutscenes using historical film material were re-cut and all words like \"Nazi\", \"Hitler\" or \"F\u00fchrer\" were avoided during localization. A detailed list of changes can be found on schnittberichte.com (German).\n\nNazis\n\nAll of the Nazis speak real German. If you go to the cheat menu, and turn on subtitles, you can see what they say if you sneak up on them unnoticed. Some of the conversations they have are quite humorous, and can be pretty long as well.\n\nReferences\n\nSeveral of the chapters in the game are actually modeled off of famous WWII movies and novels.\n\nThe first and most obvious one is the \"D-Day\" mission, modeling its missions, plot, and setting to the movie Saving Private Ryan. Besides the entire plot and completely recreated setting, several elements are borrowed from the movie, including the hopeless abandonment on the beach, the frantic bunker gunfire, shelling, and storming the seawall.\n\nChapter two, \"Storm in the Port\" also takes its setting from Saving Private Ryan. The first mission is a reenactment of the climax of the movie, where you must fight through the broken wreckage of a French town to help the Allies in their struggle against advancing Axis soldiers and tanks. The second part of the chapter, storming the German U-Boat pen, also models quite a bit of its scenery and costume design off of cliche German submarine movies.\n\nIt makes sense that the game would borrow heavily from Saving Private Ryan; Steven Spielberg directed the movie, and also had a major part in the production of the game.\n\nAnother one of these chapters in the game is titled \"Several Bridges Too Far\". This is an homage to the WWII 1970's book and movie A Bridge Too Far. The plot of the book and movie detailed Operation Market Garden, the failed Allied attempt to break through German lines at Arnhem in the occupied Netherlands.\n\nIn an reenactment, the chapter in the game puts you on the front lines of Operation Market Garden. The missions take you through the war-swept city of Arnhem, where you actually rendezvous with the men trapped behind enemy lines in Nazi occupied Netherlands. Throughout the chapter, you even meet most of the characters that are portrayed in the movie.\n\nInformation also contributed by Matt Neueboom\n\n More"

But as long as there are Mavericks causing trouble, the Maverick Hunters are there. But in recent days, X has grown weary of so many years spent in endless combat. He wishes to end the war in a peaceful method, and has removed himself from the front lines, leaving Zero to handle the hard work. In the days since this crippling blow to the Hunters, a new Syndicate named Red Alert, led by the charismatic Red, has taken up the task of the Maverick Hunters, and his newest partner, Axl, takes up battle with his mentor. Finally, the day has come: Axl escapes from Red Alert, and Red gives chase. Axl is in desperate need of help: Red Alert must be stopped, and Axl must not be allowed to fall back into their hands. X and Zero must keep Axl safe, even if it means endangering their lives.\n\nA combination of 3D platformer and 2D side-scroller, Mega Man X7 allows the player to control two characters during each level, swapping between the chosen two warriors to defeat enemies and solve any puzzles that require their unique abilities.

The game progresses as a set of memories with a calendar marking each event on a day it occurred, usually selected by the player. Unlike in many other visual novels, the on-screen text cannot be removed to display the clear background and character. Also, message history is not displayed as a separate log, but more like going backwards through the text as it appeared on the screen, with the text being in a different color to indicate it is not the current story.

        "description": "In 2007, two years after the Shadow Moses incident, Solid Snake - now working for a freelance organization known as Philanthropy - infiltrates the oil tanker U.S.S. Discovery, investigating the development of a new Metal Gear-type weapon. A confrontation with a Russian military group as well as an old acquaintance from Snake's past adventure leads to a massive detonation, after which Snake is presumed dead.\n\nFast-forward to the year 2009: the player takes control of Raiden, a rookie agent operating under the order of the Colonel, apparently a member of a reformed Foxhound unit. His initial assignment is to infiltrate the offshore clean-up facility Big Shell and rescue the President of the United States of America, who was kidnapped by members of a terrorist organization known as Sons of Liberty. However, the matters become increasingly complicated as almost everyone Raiden communicates with appears to have a hidden agenda, and it is hard to tell a friend from foe...\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty is the sequel to the espionage action game Metal Gear Solid. Much of the gameplay remains the same, as the game's protagonist has to sneak past guards, outsmart them using various gadgets, and defeat the tricky boss enemies. There are a host of weapons to be picked up throughout the game, some old, such as the FAMAS and Socom, and some new, such as the AK-47. Martial arts combos can be used to disable guards. It is possible to crawl through small spaces, peek around corners, and perform acrobatic leaps to get away. The protagonist can also hang from railings, effectively hiding from guard, or stick his gun in a guard's back, surprising him. The cardboard box is also back, and can once again be used for hiding.\n\nGadgets such as sneak suit, mine detector, thermal goggles, and others can be found along the way.. The radar from the original game is still there and alerts the player to guards' positions and also shows their field of view. If an alarm is sounded the radar is disabled while the hero has to escape. In some situations, it is necessary to enable the radar before it becomes possible to use it.\n\nLike its predecessor, the game is heavy on codec conversations and cutscenes. All the cutscenes in the game use the in-game 3D engine; the characters' movements are motion captured animations.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\n1001 Video Games\n\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nAction figures\n\nJust as for the original, a line of action figures has been released by McFarlane Toys. Most of the main characters are depicted and as an added bonus each individual figure comes with a part of the new Metal Gear. Collect them all and assemble the monster!\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe development budget for Metal Gear Solid 2 was somewhere in the region of 10 million US dollars.\n\nEnding\n\nPretty soon as the game starts and you get used to controls, you are requested to enter your name, date of birth and such things (like in some typical Square RPG games). In the ending animation, when Snake asks Raiden about that dog tag he's wearing, Raiden looks at it, before he throws it away, and in that cinematic, on a dog tag, you see your name and info.\n\nIntro\n\nOn the opening of the game, there's one piece that somehow does not fit the game without any explanation. First, we see some roman letters (numbers) etched on stone, then we see some Japanese ink writings on a paper, and then we see programming data and computer code. Hideo Kojimo commented how that was to show the advance of civilization from storaging data. First through stone, than using paper, and the least digital data which is the only that doesn't have its existing time period. And that is then connected to the game and especially Arsenal Gear as an AI with great capability to track, store and control data.\n\nMaking of\n\nOn the Making Of MGS2 documentary that comes on an extra DVD, Hideo Kojima said that idea for Metal Gear series originated from his playing 'hide and seek' with his son.\n\nNorth American version\n\nIn comparison to the Japanese version, some extra gore was added to the North American version. In the Substance re-release this was revoked.\n\nRaiden\n\nIn order to cover up the character Raiden, the promotional trailers for the game showed several scenes with Solid Snake in different scenes. In the final game, Raiden is involved in the same scenes, but in Snake's place. Hideo Kojima used computer tricks to cover up Raiden and no one knew of his existence until the game was released. However, the manual spoils the surprise on its very first pages.\n\nReferences\nJust as in the original Metal Gear Solid, a poster for Hideo Kojima's previous game Policenauts can be found in the Computer Room in the Shell 1 Core.\nIf you look quickly in the scene where Snake logs into the computer to send the pictures to Otacon, you can spot another reference to Policenauts.\nDuring the game, you will come into contact with a man named Pliskin who is actually former protagonist Solid Snake in disguise. The name is a direct reference to \"Snake\" Plissken, the main character played by Kurt Russell in John Carpenter's movies Escape from LA and Escape from New York.\nA crazy Bomber man, one of the bosses is named Fatman. That was also a name of one of the atomic bombs that fall onto Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nThe names of the characters Jack and Rose were taken from the main characters of Titanic. This film also influenced the decision to set the first chapter of the game on a sinking tanker.\nemma's nickname (E.E.) and full name (Emma Emmerich-Danziger) are references to E.E. Danziger, a character in Jack Finney's novel Time and Again.\nIn the flooded basement of Shell Core 2, you can find a rubber duck floating harmlessly in one of the air vents. While it's possible that it's just a humorous detail, it's most likely a reference to the original tech demo for the PlayStation 2 which featured a rubber duck floating in a tub.\nSeries\n\nIn a Gamespot interview done shortly after the finishing of the American release, Hideo Kojima has amended a former comment about MGS2 being the last installment, saying, \"I really think that Metal Gear has to live on in some form. But as I said at the end of Metal Gear Solid, I really think it is time for me to hand the director role over to someone else. I might do the initial planning for the next game but not much more than that.\"\n\nHe goes on to mention that the future of a certain character who is disliked in some gaming circles is still uncertain.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nDue to the success of Metal Gear Solid, the development team had a higher budget for the sound of the game. However, they didn't know who they would hire to compose the score for the game. One day, executive producer Hideo Kojima and sound director Kazuki Muraoka went to see Replacement Killers at the cinema. They both liked the movie a lot, and the music from the movie seemed pretty good. So, they flew to US, and got Harry Gregson-Williams to make the score for Metal Gear Solid 2. They actually took his music from other movies, such as The Rock, Enemy of the State and some and put on one CD, and told him they'd like to make this video game with a Hollywood type of soundtrack. He also saw the interest in composing for something before he actually saw the picture, since when composing for movies, he always got inspiration from the pictures. And so the soundtrack for MGS2 was created.\n\nWomen\n\nLooks like developers of Metal Gear Solid 2 had focused minds on some things while making a game. You open a locker, you see wrapped up posters of a women, you enter the dining hall, you see framed pictures of women in swimming suits. There is even a poster of the Charlie's Angels movie in one room.\n\nWorking Title\n\nDuring development, the game was originally going to be called Metal Gear Solid III (MGS3 for short), which would have completely skipped over the second installment of MGS. This can be seen in the Metal Gear Solid 2 Grand Game Plan by Hideo Kojima.\n\nAwards\nEGM\nFebruary 2006 (Issue #200) - #82 out of 200 of the \"Greatest Games of Their Time\" list\nGameSpy\n2001 \u2013 PS2 Game of the Year (Readers' Choice)\n2001 \u2013 PS2 Action/Adventure Game of the Year\n2001 \u2013 Best In-Game Cinematics of the Year\n2001 \u2013 Best Force-Feedback of the Year\n\nInformation also contributed by Big John WV, FinalGMR, MegaMegaMan, Mejs, J.

The stages that are set underwater are a reference to Irem's 1993 classic, In the Hunt. This is understandable as many of SNK's Metal Slug developers originally worked for Irem.\n\nReferences\nMetal Slug 3 features a number of references to sci-fi movies. For example, Mission 2 features a guest appearance by the Men in Black. The carnivorous alien plants in Mission 4 are a parody of the sci-fi musical comedy, The Little Shop of Horrors In Mission 5, the squid-like aliens are a homage to the movie, Independence Day. Also in Mission 5, the alien clones you face seem to parody the sci-fi movie classic, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired by the ending sequence in Alien: Resurrection. One of the hostages (who also appeared in Metal Slug 2 & Metal Slug X) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs.\nReferences to the game\nThe game is referenced in the 2012 non-fiction novel Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity by Katherine Boo. It is set in a slum in Mumbai, India and the game is described when one of the trash scavenger watches two boys play the game:\n\nOne night in late November, Sunil was in the game shed after an unprofitable day of scavenging, watching two boys at one of the red consoles play Metal Slug 3.

As in the original, four vehicles are on track at a time.\n\nEach track features unique terrain with ramps, tunnels, obstacles and hazards. Hidden weapons and power-ups let drivers use rockets, time warps, mines, giant frying pans and fireballs against each other to take the lead.\n\nThere are several different racing modes. In GP mode the player must reach each checkpoint within a set time limit, while Bomb Tag involves drivers being threatened with exploding unless they can hit another car in order to 'tag' the bomb onto it. In the main Championship there are four cups, each featuring four races.",

And if you have a car that can race the distance, there's money involved too.\n\nThis is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities.\n\nEach race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first.\n\nEach race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You'll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes.\n\nMultiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.",

        "description": "For over a thousand years, the races of the Ancients and the Kreegans were waging an interstellar war. Eventually, the heroes of the planet Enroth and their allies managed to stop the invading Kreegans. However, the Ancients would rather see an entire world annihilated than let it fall into the hands of their sworn enemies. A planeswalker named Escaton, serving the Ancients, arrives on the continent of Jadame and unleashes a great storm, damaging the borders to Elemental Planes. Terrifying creatures begin to invade Enroth. Unexpectedly, the fate of the world lies in the hands of a lowly caravan guard from Dagger Wound Islands.\n\nDay of the Destroyer is the eighth installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to For Blood and Honor. The game's engine is virtually unchanged from the one used in the sixth game, apart from a few minor tweaks. The biggest difference from all the previous games in the series is the player's inability to create an entire party. Instead, the player generates one character, while the others at first act as NPCs in the game world and must be recruited. The active party can hold up to five characters. Instead of the traditional classes, the differentiation of the characters is mainly manifested in their races, which include, among others, minotaurs, vampires, and dark elves. The player can also choose to ally with different factions and complete different quests for them.",

This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.\n\nGraphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.",

In Thoroughbred mode take control of Ford Romfellow and experience the events of the manga Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: Space, To the End of a Flash. In Mission mode create your own Federation or Zeon pilot and train their skills and abilities over eight missions. In Ace Pilot mode see the war from the view of characters from the One Year War and 0083: Stardust Memory, as well as characters from the model line Mobile Suit Variations and the video game trilogy Mobile Suit Gundam: Side Story: The Blue Destiny.\n\nSelect from over 70 mobile suits (although your MS is usually chosen for you outside of Versus mode) with their own stats, equipment list, and special attacks. Combat takes place in 3-D space where you have complete control of a unit's forward, backward, and side to side movement as well as pitch and yaw. Boosting can be used to move faster, and barrel rolling will break any enemies' target locks on your MS. Units are equipped with melee weapons as well as ranged weapons, but ranged weapons have limited ammunition and must reload or cool down after being expended. Missions consist of both auto-scrolling segments where the player must avoid obstacles and destroy visible targets as well as arena segments where the player must track down nearby targets.\n\nIn Versus mode you can challenge either the computer or another player to one on one combat with a team of 1-3 pilots and MSs. Each MS and weapon has a point cost, and a team's total point cost can not exceed 300 points. Additional pilots and MSs can be unlocked by achieving high scores in the other modes' missions.

        "description": "Mojib Ribbon is the psuedo-sequel to Vib Ribbon. Instead of being based around the tone of your music, it revolves around lyrics and rap. The protagonist, Mojibri, wants to become a famous rapper. You assist him in this as he raps his way through various stages. Along the way, Mojibri meets two other characters - a girl called Mojiko, and a robot called Osorezan. Although they look different, gameplay is all the same. You only use up and down on the Right Analog Stick for all control.\n\nIn each level, Mojibri will be walking along a circle of clouds. Gameplay is similar to writing with a pen - you need to lift your brush (by pressing up) to get ink, then press down just as you walk on markers that are on certain parts of the clouds. This will start Mojibri writing, and he will read out what he's writing as he does so. You then need to let go of the Analog Stick at the end of the sentence to finish it properly.\n\nAs with other Nana On-Sha games, timing is the key. Press or lift your brush too early, and the writing becomes scratchy. Too late, and it's all blotchy. The game itself is fairly simple and straightforward, but it has a real artistic flair, and the program used to read out the Japanese text is very accurate. If you write your name in katakana for the name entry screen, you'll hear it read by Mojibri every so often in-game, too.",

Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs.

This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date.\n\nYour goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode.\n\nThe game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.\n\nMonsters can also be made by finding in-game items, and through combining your retired monsters, so having a large collection of discs is not necessary. The game features some cute monsters, some scary/gory types, and enough variety to keep almost anyone busy for a long time.\n\nMonster Rancher 4 is easy enough that almost anyone can dive in and play right away, making it a natural for kids. -But like the other games in the series, a patient player will be rewarded with a deeper, more rewarding experience (and hundreds of hours of gameplay). Replay value on this game, like the other Monster Rancher games is very high.",

There was loads of advertising on TV, magazines, radio, the tube etc. for the game. Most of the ads had blood in them, though not extensively. For example, one ad had a girlfriend hugging her boyfriend and as she pulled away, there were bloody hand-prints where her hands had been on his back.\n\nBo' Rai Cho\n\nThe new character featured in the game, Bo' Rai Cho, is notable for being drunk all the time and farting often. His name is a play on his character: the Spanish word \"borracho\" translates to \"drunk\".\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe first game in the series done without John Tobias (MK co-creator).\n\nReferences\nThe name of the fighter Noob Saibot is the name of the franchise masterminds backwards; Ed Boon and John Tobias.\nJohnny Cage in this game is an obvious tribute to the actor/martial artist Bruce Lee. Like Lee, Cage is also both film star and martial artist. Moreover, one of Cage's fighting styles in this game is Jeet Kune Do, and his weapon is the Nunchaku. These are respectively the martial art created by Bruce Lee and his signature weapon.\nThe secret character Mokap is based on Carlos Pesina, who was the motion capture expert for the game.\nAlthough the character Blaze was basically introduced in this game, he actually appeared as a background character for the Pit II stage in Mortal Kombat II. Also, his original name was Torch.\nWhen browsing through some of the extras found in the game (biographies, videos, official comics), the player is able to have a view on the names of fictional films where the character Johnny Cage has starred in, several of which are references to real life movies. For instance, \"Citizen Cage\" is a spoof of Citizen Kane, \"Tommy Scissorfists\" is a reference to Edward Scissorhands, \"World's Most Wanted\" is a spoof of Wanted, and many more.\nAwards\nGameSpy\n2002 \u2013 \"Return to Form\" Award (PS2)\n\nInformation also contributed by Karthik KANE, Macintrash and Steve .\n\n More"

This is not a simulation where real players and courses are recreated in minute photorealistic detail, this is a fun game where the players are all drawn in a cute cartoony style and the courses are all fictitious.\n\nThere are two modes of play, stroke play or match play. Matches can be over three, six, nine or eighteen holes. Initially there are six characters to play as and just four courses but others can be unlocked by winning full eighteen hole matches.\n\nThere is no player creation feature, no career mode and no difficulty settings in this game. There is background music and an in-game commentary which was a surprise but this is limited to stock phrases such as 'Nice shot!', 'You've kept it on the fairway', 'Bad luck' and so on.\n\nThere is an in-game tutorial which covers all the controls. By default the right analogue stick controls the shot, the further back it is pulled the more power is transferred to the swing when the stick is pushed forward, while the left analogue stick aims the shot so that the player can allow for the wind. There is a game configuration option that swaps the use of the right/left sticks around. The 'best' club is auto selected by the game but this can be changed by using R1/L1 to cycle through available clubs, R2/L2 change the player's stance. When taking a shot the player can take as many practice swings as they like to gauge how much back swing they want to use, the right D-Pad button swaps the player from practice mode into shot mode to take the actual shot.\n\nThe full game has fourteen playable characters, eight courses plus 'mirrored courses' all of which can be played in any of four seasons.",

The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the \"Prime Jump\" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.",

        "description": "My Merry Maybe visual novel romance adventure game is a sequel to My Merry May visual novel in a similar style with other visual novels developed by KID. The game opens with the protagonist of the story, Hiroto Kishimori, a college student visiting a rural area for a teaching practice, driving together with a high-school principal at night in a rural area. While talking, they notice a white female silhouette on the road, barely managing to hit the breaks in time. Not sure whether what they saw was a real thing or a ghost, they exit the car only to find a young girl on the ground. They put her in the car and rush to the nearby town to find a doctor and help her regain her consciousness. After waking up at the school infirmary, in shock at first, she identifies herself as Rev, a humanoid artificial life form also known as Reprise. She has no memory of who her master is, an naturally, Hiroto ends up being her guardian until her owner is found.\n\nThe gameplay and user interface is similar with many other visual novels providing basic functions such as auto-play and pause, hide on-screen text to see background image and characters, message log which can be voice re-played, and many other game options which are almost identical to those in KID's Memories Off series. Aside from the player character, all other characters, male and female, feature full voice-acting. Characters change poses to depict different attitudes, but also include mouth animations during most of the dialogues.\n\nAs a direct sequel to My Merry May, My Merry Maybe continues the story which was originally planned as a trilogy. While both of the games are limited to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 platforms, later PlayStation 2 release under the name My Merry May with Be includes both May and Maybe stories as well as additional scenarios.",

Each of these parts can then be assigned different colors.\n\nThe neighborhood is explored in 3rd person perceptive and includes a slide, monkey bars, swings and a merry-go-round to play on. In addition to My House, there are seven houses in the neighborhood. At each house lives a kid who asks the player to play a mini-game. Mini-games include RC Racing, Volleyball, Dodgeball, Chemistry, Marbles, Lawn-mowers, and Chicken Herding. The games can be played with two to four kids that can either be controlled by humans or computer. Up to four people can play the game, either through a multi-tap or online. All the games are fully 3D but are viewed from a stationary camera so that the entire play field and all four kids can be viewed at the same time.\n\nMini-Games\n\nEach mini-game has three difficulty levels.",

If the files from the 4 CDs are placed on a DVD in just the right places, it will work with the current app. ie: not producing a Mac/PC DVD version is purely a marketing decision.

        "description": "Mystic Heroes is an action game loosely based on the novel Fengshen Yanyi (16th century). The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. There are eight playable characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe combat is basically a combination of sword attacks, magical attacks and combo attacks. During the course of the game, the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact, some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for this and gets to retain their abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the main story mode, there is also a Survival mode.\n\nThis version of the game features several additions in comparison to the GameCube version: increased magic levels (depending on the runes equipped), four new playable characters, a new boss, levels can be chosen separately after beating the game, plus the new Mission Mode. In this mode, the player has to solve small missions, e.g. defending a castle or escorting ghosts.",

In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added: Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan.\n\nThe characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death.

From the main menu the player can start a new game or they can select a WWII option. In the 'normal' game the player can invest in technology and use this to build new ships, in WWII mode the game is played with World War II ships from either the USA, Japan, England or Germany and is limited to the technology of the period.\n\nThe game consists of three areas of battle, each area has ten stages and the player must complete one stage before they can progress to the next. Each stage starts in the dock, this is where the ship is equipped with new armament, weapons and so-on, alternatively the player can scrap their ship and use the parts and the cash they have to design and build another to their own design.\nOnce the re-fit is complete the mission begins and the game makes success / failure really easy to understand - Complete the objective and escape and it's a successful mission, sink and it's not. Once the mission is over there's a battle report to review and it's on to the next mission.\n\nShips are not limited to battleships with big guns, there are aircraft carriers too. Ships can be repaired while afloat and power-ups can be picked up by sailing over them.\n\nCompleting the game unlocks a Survival Mode in which the player selects a class of ship and stays with that unmodified ship throughout a replay of the game.",

        "description": "Electronic Arts' college basketball series returns for another year on the PlayStation 2 and makes its debut on the Xbox with NCAA March Madness 2004.\n\nThe number of included teams has been doubled to over 320 from the predecessor and several authentic arenas have been added. All the previous year's game modes return, including single games, tournaments, season and dynasty. Newly added are the mascot game, in which the teams consist of players in their schools' mascot outfits. A rivalry mode allows a quick set-up of a game pitching classic rival teams against each other. The dynasty mode has added Campus Challenges: by completing these challenges in dynasty games, players earn points that can be used to improve players' stats. Exclusive to the PS2 version is the introduction of online multiplayer, featuring single games and tournaments.\n\nSome of the gameplay changes on the court were previously seen in NBA Live 2004: these include the separation of the buttons for dunks and shots and the introduction of the pro hop button, which allows for context-sensitive special offensive moves.",

Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.\n\nChoose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.\n\nThe competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.\n\nThe Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.",

Often, games only get LAN play because developers don't want to deal with latency issues and different networks. EA on the other hand, developed a \"Cross Platform Online Gaming\" feature, which allows gamers to compete online on different platforms (e.g. PS2 vs PC), but there's a catch: no LAN play on PC. This means that players have go through an external network connection just to join a server sitting right next to them.\n\nSoon after the game's release,a tool making LAN play possible appeared on various fansites. It also features an option to play over the Internet without using EA's server.\n\nServer shutdown\n\nAs of 13th January 2006, The EA servers for the game are no longer in service.

As your admirals search far and wide, you get the privilege of believing or disbelieving in their reports of the world afar, and this influences the shape of the map as you uncover more and more of it. In turn, this affects the resources available, treasure you find, events which occur, and obstacles in your way.\n\nUnlike prior Neo ATLAS titles, the world is a globe from the start, rather than depending on your belief in the concept as you progress. It additionally brings back the concept of discovering the \"cultures\" of the world as the home computer iterations did, and in this version you can enable people to migrate which affects the cultural makeup of cities and regions.",

        "description": "NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway's arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can \"catch on fire\". The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays.\n\nGame modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates.\n\nThe game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.",

        "description": "Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create teams and players.\n\nIn general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you'll see a list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they've left, which are usually related to injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you'll need to make every effort to ensure that those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You're frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money you've set aside for that purpose. When you're all done, it's time to start the next season.\n\nThere's also a tournament mode where you can select up to 16 teams. There's also a regular season mode, similar to the franchise mode, except it lacks the off-season part.\n\nGameDay's best new feature is online play support. You can view your online stats, and see who the best players are online to challenge.",

You take on the role of GM for up to twenty seasons. As GM, you'll have to negotiate contracts, conduct drafts, make trades, sign free agents, make sure your players are getting the training they need, and more. If you're good enough, you may make it into the GM Hall of Fame.\n\nBesides Dynasty mode, you've got the basic game modes; Season, Exhibition, and Playoffs.\n\nThe control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games. Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button.\n\nNHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights. The right analog stick controls \"Bruise Control\", which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions. Before you get into fights, you'll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in. Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check.\n\nNHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game. Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in NASCAR Thunder 2004) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums. This feature isn't found on the PC version.\n\nIn addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany's DEL or Sweden's Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 and Windows versions of NHL 2004 support online play.",

A forum called \"NHL04 Rebuilt\" is dedicated to various fan-made modifications, ranging from roster updates for existing leagues, total conversion mods for competely different leagues and even retro rosters. Some aspects of the game, particularly the handling of statistics within the menus, are improved over the stock version as well.

Hockey may have fewer rules than football, but NHL Hitz features hard-hitting action and very simple 3-on-3 gameplay. The game has franchise modes for a created team that you can design along with championship and exhibition modes. You earn attribute points and credits that you can use to unlock items and improve your players along the way. There are several mini-games and extras hidden deep in the game for you to unlock. NHL Hitz is Midway's attempt at making the most action-packed hockey game to ever hit consoles.",

All 30 NHL teams are represented with motion-capture animation, and you can build your own players with the Create-Player option. The game's Season mode now allows for trades, stat tracking, and player awards.\n\nUp to four players can play each other in exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a shorter season if you want. There is also a small numer of hockey-related minigames, such as keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a \"boss team\" for that region. Beating that team nets you some new equipment for your players, which also improves their stats.",

        "description": "NHL Hitz Pro is Midway's 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.\n\nAs with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.",

Like its predecessor, it features several levels full of challenging enemies to fight using a combination of your sword, shuriken, and magic scrolls. Speed and stealth remain the emphasis, as you use stealth dashes and the ability to walk on walls to perform long strings of kills called tates. One of the main improvements to the gameplay system is the ability to create much larger combos/tates. In order to facilitate this, they've expanded the battle system to include flying kicks to break your opponent's guard and stealth attacks to kill unsuspecting foes in a single blow.",

Other modes include Single Race, Time Attack and the rather cool Keirin mode, that eliminates the contestant in last place at every checkpoint until the last man remains.\n\nIn every race, you can pick up 4 elements which give you an added advantage: Water - leaves a liquid sphere behind you that slows your opponents down if they hit it, Fire - allows you to shoot a homing fireball at your opponents, Earth activates a temporary shield and Air - gives you a speed boost. 3 Dimensional action allows the player complete freedom of movement on a vertical and horizontal axis. The races take place on 12 tracks, which can be unlocked by advancing through levels. The tracks are divided into four districts: Jet Set, Middle Class, Seedy District and China Town.",

        "description": "Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous.\n\nThe game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world.\n\nThe game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.",

        "description": "It's 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind's problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn't improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called \"Wilderness Preserves\" are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.\n\nKonoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt \"different\" to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called \"Boss Muro\" climbed to the top of the organization.\n\nInspired by the classic Anime series Ghost in the Shell by Shirow Masamune, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat'em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon: a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can \"overdose\" on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.",

With vengeance in his heart, Jubei launches upon an epic and magical quest, which will reveal his ultimate destiny.\n\nLike Samanoske before him, Jubei can absorb the souls of defeated monsters to strengthen his weapons and armor.

In the game, there is a demon who constantly refers to himself as the greatest swordsman among all demons, and unlike all other enemies, he's the only one that always fights fair, plus they both say almost the same sentence after being defeated, like in far disbelief. * Furthermore, the main nemesis in the movie was human but is now the boss of those demons Jubei fights, while in the game, main nemesis was also once human but is now the king of demons.\n\nSales\n\nAccording to publisher Capcom, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny has sold 2.1 million copies worldwide since its initial release (as of September 30, 2018).\n\n More"

        "description": "Onimusha: Warlords is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres.\n\nWith this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.\n\nThe 2018 enhanced HD version for Windows and consoles now supports 16:9 wide screen resolution as well as the old 4:3 ratio. Improved controls now allow players to move and fight with analog-stick precision.",

Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi show up as villains, while Imagawa Yoshitomo makes a very brief, and final appearance in the introduction movie. Even the hero is the nephew of Akechi Mitsuhide, the infamous retainer of Nobunaga who eventually betrayed him.\n\nWhile tales attribute Nobunaga's ruthlessness to some evil or demonic nature, the events of the game are, of course, completely fictional (aside from Nobunaga's attack on Yoshitomo's troops).\n\nSales\n\nIn January of 2001, Capcom released Onimusha. And, in the same month, it became the PS2's first 1 million seller according to Capcom Co., Ltd.'s corporate page. As of June 30, 2016 it has sold 2.02 million copies worldwide since its initial release.\n\nTitle\n\nOnimusha is Japanese for 'demon warrior'.

        "description": "The game is based on the hit Japanese anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, (released outside of Japan as just Orphen). Orphen, his apprentice Majik, traveling partner Cleo and her pet dog/magical-wolf Leki, and the two mischievous trolls Volkan and Dorton, sail to the mysterious Chaos Island in search of wealth and riches. Also on the voyage are three strangers whose destinies pull Orphen and his companions into their mysterious journey. Only the powerful dark sorcerer Orphen (in his trademark bemused manner) can discover what connections there are between the three strangers and the powers that rule the island, and keep himself and his companions alive long enough to find a way off of the ephemeral Chaos Island.\n\nOrphen: Scion of Sorcery is an action game with some light RPG elements. Orphen is a dark sorcerer and attacks his enemies with various spells including a magical sword and elementals. The game is played in the third-person perspective looking over Orphen's shoulder. You will run, jump, and explore your way through large levels on Chaos Island in varying environments; engage in boss battles that require you to use some puzzle solving and timing skills; and level up your dark magic. Once beaten, the game encourages replay by following branching story lines not taken in the previous play-through. The game maintains the feeling of the anime, particularly in the character designs and bantering dialogue. Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is entirely voice acted.",

Saw's job is to lay down these icons in contiguous water-earth-tree combinations in order to create small houses on earth patches. Plop down a 5 x 5 grid of these combinations and you'll create a little neighborhood. Once you've laid down the foundation of your fledgling town, drop down additional building supplies to develop the houses into bigger buildings, all the way up to towers which resemble the Eiffel Tower. At one point, if you reach a certain level of development, the towers shine rays of light towards the heavens in an impressive visual show. Each level moves slowly from left to right, destroying columns of development on the left while new columns rises on the right. Your goal is to build structures and develop them fast enough so that the erstwhile town reaches full avenue strength by the time they fall off the map.

His captors introduce themselves as members of Inferno, an international syndicate of the world's most ruthless assassins. Seeing potential in our protagonist, Inferno offers him the choice to be trained in the art of killing and join their ranks, or to die then and there. After the man, who is henceforth known as \"Zwei\", begins his training, he learns that killing is not as straightforward as it sounds, and experiences romance and betrayal as he moves through Inferno's ranks and uncovers his identity.\n\nPhantom of Inferno is an edited version of the original PC game of the same name. It features the same overall story, but has a different script written by Yukihito Nonaka, Hideki Shirane, and Masashi Suzuki with oversight from the original writer, Gen Urobuchi. Like its predecessor, it is an adult visual novel where the player's decisions determine the outcome of the story. It has updated graphics and full voice acting for all characters, but lacks the original game's sexual content.",

Also loosely based on Piglet's Big Movie, this version of Piglet's Big Game has a different story and objectives than the PC/Mac version released separately. Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements.\n\nIn the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don't believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps.\n\nIn each of the 6 dream \"levels\", Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren't frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin's balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.\n\nAfter the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.",

Additional costumes, items, and characters can be unlocked through this mode.

She married Marcus de Leon, the governor of the Pirate Isles, and they had a daughter named Katarina. The governor always wanted to protect her from the dangers of a pirate's life - especially after her mother disappeared without a trace. But when the ruthless Captain Hawke begins to terrorize the islands with his gang, the Crimson Guard, Katarina realizes she must find a way to stop him at all costs.\n\nPirates: The Legend of Black Kat is an action game consisting of two main modes: sailing and land exploration. While sailing, Katarina's ship encounters hostile vessels and may engage in naval battles. The player must explore islands on foot to find special items that would unlock new areas on the map. Each island is a fairly linear area with respawning enemies hindering Katarina's progress. The player can also find keys allowing him to unlock treasure chests, and search for various items for collecting purposes.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nGamePro review\n\nAfter GamePro gave the game a score of two out of five, Trip Hawkins sent an angry e-mail to the editor-in chief John Rousseau. In it, he complains about the poor quality of the review, threatens with stopping to advertise in the magazine, and clearly implies that the real customer of a magazine are the advertisers and not the readers.\n\nThe mail in its entirety:\n\nHello John,\n\nWe at 3DO were very discouraged by the slam-job...on Portal Runner. I would hope you can recognize that I do not love all my children equally and can be objective about both good and bad features in a game as well as games that are of quality and those that are not. I do not send messages like this to you after every review. But this happens to be a game that I have played all the way through and beaten on all difficulty levels and I know the game intimately. I also have seen the profound positive effect this game has had on my children.\n\nThis sort of thing is really tragic because your online review excerpt was the first public review of Portal Runner, and it set the tone by telling the hardcore what to think. It closed minds that it could have opened. And even though your reviewer is hardly an authority on either games in general or Portal Runner specifically, his voice will be heard louder and taken more seriously than others. It's not right and it's not fair.\n\nIn any case, your reviewer blew it on this one. And we are re-evaluating our relationship with GamePro as a result.\n\nI think it is unprofessional of a reviewer to assume he represents all his readers and all market segments and can therefore dismiss a game based purely on his personal experience of a game, particularly when he has no context about the goals and target audience of the game publisher.\n\nThe audience for games no longer consists of one iconic block of angry young men who cannot get a date on Saturday night. Reviewers who don't consult with the game publisher about the intended audience, and don't attempt to position a game in terms of who might like it and who might not like it, are unprofessional. I furthermore propose as a solution the idea that you assign a journalist during the preview stage of a game, and provide professional follow thru by having that same journalist write the review. In the case of Portal Runner, we had some ambition to reach a wider audience. We wanted to include boys, girls, women, and casual gaming men. I know from firsthand experience that Portal Runner is a hit with all of those market segments. Many of your readers are in those segments. But your reviewers are not. Meanwhile, I personally think we made a game that hard-core adult male gamers would enjoy. But I can understand that some of them would reject it the same way some adults reject Shrek or Beethoven. But personally, I think that really means there is something wrong with a man like that, not with Portal Runner.\n\nIf you disagree with me, you do so at your own peril. The industry is in a malaise. As you know, most game publishers are losing money and have cut back on advertising. Many magazines and webzines have perished. What seems needless to me is the often overly negative tone that gaming editorial takes.\n\nMost of you have editorial staffs that are dominated by angry young men that are poorly trained and represent a narrow and anarchistic element of the world's population. They have a negative attitude and are looking for what is wrong with something, instead of looking for what is right and who might like it.\n\nIt reminds me of boys at junior high school dance. With their fragile egos, they stay on the sideline and say the band sucks, the girls are ugly, and that those brave enough to dance are lousy dancers. Your reviewers have no idea how to make a great game. None of them have ever made one. But they sure have fun telling us in a nasty tone how inferior we are to them.\n\nI truly find it astonishing that magazines like yours seem willing to slit your own throats on occasions like this. You have so much more to gain if you are enthusiasts for gaming, and try to find the audience for a new game. You are so much better off if you do not bite the hand that feeds you. And do not patronize me by telling me the reader is the customer--your real customer is the one that pays you your revenue. And it is game industry advertisers. If you need to be able to be constantly negative you need to accept that you are like a parasite that is killing its host. In God's millions of years he has not created nor evolved a creature that would have such a stupid strategy for survival. But it is a common attitude among game magazines, despite the evidence all around them that it drives many of them into bankruptcy. You have been around long enough to know that this is true, but you have not adapted your publication.\n\nI should mention in passing that 3DO has been one of your largest advertisers. Effective immediately, we are going to have to cut that back. If a consumer sees a bad editorial, and a positive ad, they are going to assume the ad is biased (what is frustrating is that often it is the other way around). But to make matters worse, they will think the advertiser is stupid, and it will reinforce their confidence that the editorial must be accurate, because it is also saying the game publisher is stupid. So, I don't go for that. In addition, it makes far more sense to give financial support to publications that are more professional and more fair. There are only so many bucks to go around.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you owe us one because you took us by surprise and threw our review to a wolf. And you accepted his word as God without even checking in with a major advertiser or wondering about how it makes you look to rip a game you chose to put on a recent cover.\n\nI think we share a common vision--which is to get more people to play games and appreciate what a great thing it is to be at play. I know you are proud of the circulation increases of GamePro. We both are doing things to try to expand the audience for gaming. Unfortunately, our efforts to expand beyond the angry young hardcore are being counteracted by your angry young reviewers who don't share either my vision or yours.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTrip\n\n More"

        "description": "After many versions developed by Realms of Fantasy and Dinamic Multimedia, when Gremlin was acquired and then disbanded, it seemed this long-running series were about to end, but in 2002 ZOO Digital announced the return.\n\nFeaturing five nations (England with three leagues and Germany, Spain, France and Italy with two), PM takes a new approach to the series, not much different from the classic Match Day Manager. Each day has several time slots (from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.) which your secretary can fill with appointments with other staff members, the chairman or players in order to discuss contracts and other working orders. While you can act freely between time slots, most actions can only be completed after a meeting with the staff.\n\nAs usual with managers with less detailed databases (those who don't allow to manage in the Estonian second division while tapping the youth pool in Taiwan), the player is also in control of setting ticket prices (and stadium building), advertising and website (which increases the value of the club, and lead to higher merchandise sales) and manage staff.\n\nAll staff conversations and player information screens are presented in full 3D, as well as the match engine. The news screen is based on real-life sports news TV channel EurosportNews.",

A strange and powerful creature attacks Lewis after a concert and runs off into the night with him, leaving Jen injured and near-death.\n\nJen meets a short gargoyle named Scree, who informs her that she must leave the physical plane Mortalis and accompany him to the demon plane Oblivion. The creature who kidnapped Lewis and left her for dead is an agent of Abaddon who represents Chaos and has been locked in struggle for aeons with Arella, representing Order. The balance between Chaos and Order has been upset and it is Jen's task to restore the balance, all the while hoping to discover the whereabouts of Lewis.\n\nPrimal can be described as a \"3D platformer\", being somewhat similar in its basic gameplay mechanics to Tomb Raider games. Puzzle-solving and action-based combat constitute the focus of the gameplay. The player can switch between Jen and Scree at any time; Jen is capable of fighting, but Scree is invulnerable to enemy attacks. When Jen is incapacitated in combat, Scree must quickly restore her to life within a time limit; failure to do so prematurely ends the game.\n\nCombat is heavily based on \"finishing moves\" and Jen's ability to transform into demonic forms. There are four demons Jen can merge herself with; they are obtained one by one as the game's narrative advances. These demonic forms allow Jen to use special abilities, which include jumping to extreme heights, unnaturally fast swimming, slowing down time, and using powerful weapons.",

A DHTML overlay showing the Prince slicing through the computer screen with his sword had a click-through rate of 26.1%.

        "description": "It is World War II, and the player takes the role of an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.\n\nPrisoner of War can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game.",

Unfortunately an epidemic infests all kingdoms except the one inhabited by the unicorns. Of course this leads to accusations and the unicorn Pryzm is sent out to end the plague - she is accompanied by the troll magician Karrock who distrusts her. The player takes control over both of them at the same time: the left analogue stick controls the unicorn and the right one the troll.\n\nThe basic gameplay is simple: the player rides through the 16 levels and battles infected flora and fauna. After defeat they transform back to their real selves - if the whole level (including the periodic mini bosses) is rescued the player can proceed to the next one. The roles of the heroes are evenly divided: Pryzm is used for moving at different speeds, jumping and defensive spells, e.g. stun. Karrock on the other hand uses offensive spells and his magic wand to hit the enemies nearby. The game can be played in first or third person perspective.",

        "description": "Two games in one pack (Psyvariar Medium Unit together with revision), Psyvariar is a vertical-scrolling sci-fi shooter.\n\nIn the game, the human race has been exiled out of the solar system, and now live a peaceful existence under the watchful eye of the GUIS AI. Unfortunately a recent super nova has caused the AI to go out of control, and threatens to use the same weapons and defensive capabilities that kept humanity alive in outer space to completely destroy them.\n\nYou star as a lone pilot who must fly his mecha deep into the core of GUIS and destroy it before its too late, shooting your way through several enemy-infested stages (6 in the original, 8 in the arranged version) with the next stage being decided by the rank you get in the previous one. The game doesn't feature much in the way of power-ups or upgradeable weapons, but instead features the unique \"Buzz\" system, which increases your rate of fire and power in relation to horizontal rolling and movement, encouraging the player to move all over the screen. Also, your mecha has a unique power-bar that can only be filled by \"buzzing\" enemy bullets, which involves getting close to said bullets so that they scrape the edges of your mecha and charge it up. When max power is reached you can become invulnerable for a short time, which you can use to continue buzzing and extend your invulnerability to survive the intricate attack patterns.\n\nThe game uses polygonal graphics and features both the original arcade Psyvariar Medium Unit and a Revision mode, which upgrades the graphics and adds a few stages.",

        "description": "The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2. There are two levels of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941. If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies. Players can also concoct \"what-if\" scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.\n\nThe world map used in the turn-based grand strategy side of the game is broken down into territories connected in a web of lines indicating where fleets may pass from territory to territory. Game turns on this scale represent one month, and the time it takes a fleet to move from one territory to another correlates loosely to the length of the line connecting them.\n\nPlayers collect resources from the territories they control every turn. Resources include money, iron ore, aluminum, and oil. Money is used for construction of new units and facilities and to speed scientific development, iron is used in construction of ships, aluminum is used in construction of aircraft, and oil is consumed when fleets move.\n\nTechnological advances are not purchased; instead players direct their scientists to focus on particular developmental paths, and breakthroughs come semi-randomly. The longer the scientists have been working on a particular problem, the more likely a breakthrough becomes. Giving the scientists extra money accelerates this process. In addition to the ship and aircraft types that become available automatically with scientific advancements, players can design their own custom types using whatever technology is available to them at the time.\n\nPlayers decide which types of ships and aircraft to build and how many. Ships are formed into fleets that can be moved about the world map while aircraft can be assigned to defend land-based airfields or assigned to fleets with ships capable of carrying aircraft.\n\nWhen two hostile fleets meet in the same territory, or when a hostile fleet enters a territory defended by land-based aircraft, a battle ensues. Battles are controlled in real-time with a 3-D isometric view. Players control entire fleets, not individual ships. Orders include sending a fleet to a particular point, ordering a fleet to attack a particular other fleet or airfield, and launching and recovering aircraft for CAP or to attack a particular fleet or airfield.\n\nPlayers can assign the computer to control as much or as little of strategy as desired. A player who enjoys the turn-based grand strategy but not the real-time battles can have the computer automatically resolve individual battles. Conversely, a player who enjoys the real time battles but not resource management can assign various aspects of resource management to the computer so that the player only has to decide where to move fleets. At the extreme, a player could even assign fleet movement to the computer and focus entirely on real-time combat. The game also offers a scenario mode that skips grand strategy entirely and throws the player into an individual battle.",

Like other games in the R-Type Series, the game is a scrolling shooter where you need to guide a spaceship through various stages and destroy the many enemies (including very large end of level bosses). The game features a large variety of spaceships (over 100!) to choose from, each with varying capabilities. Regardless of which ship you choose, you begin the game with limited firepower; you can fire a basic weapon, or hold down a button to charge up and fire a more powerful burst. Occasionally power ups will appear on the screen; collect these to equip your ship with additional weapons, including a variety of lasers, missiles, and other useful items. In addition to the normal game, an AI VS mode is also included. In this mode, you can set up one of your available fighters to be controlled by the computer and then fight it to see who wins in various battles.",

It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.\n\nRatchet & Clank includes many of the common features seen in previous similar games, but distinguishes itself in a number of ways. The game's levels are fairly vast and contain detailed structures which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). The game also includes a number of prominently featured mini-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person.\n\nThe game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many cutscenes made with in-game graphics which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.",

        "description": "Admiral Razorbeard and his gang of robot pirates have enslaved all the creatures in Rayman's world, including the peaceful Teensies and the Lums, which give life to the earth. Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world!\n\nRayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, Rayman 2 is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.\n\nRayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 and Windows platforms are the original versions of the game. The Nintendo DS version sticks closest to this version.\n\nThe Dreamcast version adds a new area to the original version called Globox Village which contains exclusive mini-games. The mini-games are unlocked by collecting six hidden Globox crystals. Also, other changes include The Hall of Doors being changed into a new place called The Isle of Doors and more Robo-Pirates to contend with, including a new type not seen in the original version. The iOS and Nintendo 3DS versions are based on this version but don't include the Globox Village section. However, the 3DS version features a dynamic difficulty curve, with the game getting easier if too many lums are missed.\n\nThe PlayStation version features a heavy alteration of the levels with some being merged and some being removed altogether, although there are also some new areas as well. This includes a new unlockable bonus area that was from the originally planned 2D version of the game that was scrapped. The amount of collectible Lums was reduced from 1,000 to 800. In this version characters are also voiced with actual real languages instead of the whisper speak of the other versions.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version adds minigames, exclusive items like the Lumz Radar, and offers more abilities for Rayman to purchase and use. Along with some expanded level revisions with lums being placed in different locations, there are three new bosses to contend with. The Hall of Doors has become hub locations, The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House, and The Rainbow Creek. Bonus challenges can also be played by freeing caged Familiar Spirits. These prisoners are exclusive to this version of the game. The game also gives the option to use either the real language voice-overs or the older version's style and lets players save mid-level.",

The original name of Razorbeard was **Razorface**. The original name of the Teensies was **Smalbeings**. The original name of Polokus was **Polochus**. And the robo-pirates were originally named **the Mysterious Guild**.\n\nDevelopment history\n\nOriginally, during the early development of Rayman 2: The Great Escape, it was going to be a 2D side-scroller. However, because of the new and constant usage of 3D graphics in games of that era, the original 2D design was scrapped and Ubisoft decided to make their franchise 3D as well. Details and screenshots of the original prototype can be seen here.\n\nExtras\n\nThe PSX release of Rayman 2 originally came with a digital watch.\n\nJapanese version\n\nIn Japan, purple is the colour of death. Because of that, some characters with purple in them were changed. Rayman's body was made blue, Sssssam the snake turned into a kind of green, and Jano's hat was turned red. But the most bizarre change was made to Ly, who's body was changed from orange/purple to white/pink.\n\nReferences\n\nThe purple general who sells Razorbeard the Grolgoth is also featured in Tonic Trouble's opening cinematic.\n\nAwards\nPC Player\nIssue 01/2000 - named as \"Best Platformer in 1999\"Information also contributed by Arejarn, Kalrac, and Patrick Bregger\n More"

        "description": "Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world into a deadly possibility. By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox.\n\nRayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the \"shoot\" button.\n\nThe game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment.\n\nRayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level.\n\nRayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar.\n\nThere are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.\n\nThe PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are straight ports of the original game with HD textures and a smooth framerate. They also add nine short mini-games.",

        "description": "The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by \"Eos\". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive \"Red Faction\". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and its workers, any little incident could ignite...\n\nRed Faction is a first-person shooter. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in a less protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most of which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.\n\nRed Faction features a game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths, tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.",

Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.\n\nMultiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.",

Ultimately, this decision was scrapped due to Leon's popularity, and the ill-fated role was written for a new character, Steve Burnside. This explains why Leon and Steve are so similar in appearance.\n\nGerman index\n\nOn March 29, 2003, Resident Evil: Code: Veronica X (PS2) was put on the infamous German index by the BPjS. For more information about what this means and to see a list of games sharing the same fate, take a look here: BPjS/BPjM indexed games.\n\nGerman PS2 version\n\nAn anecdote written by phlux:\n\nElectronic Arts made quite a fuss about releasing the PS2 version of this game in Germany. It was released one or two days before the WTC disaster occurred. We got our ordered number of games and sold them rather quickly. When I wanted to get some more, I was told that \"EA doesn't support violence in games any more because they are an US company blah blah\" and they wouldn't sell Veronica X any longer and I should tell my customers about it. I did and told everyone who wanted to buy the game that it was discontinued. No store carried it for a while. Then, some weeks had passed, the game re-appeared in stores\n\nReferences to the game\n\nIn the second RE movie known as Resident Evil: Apocalypse not too far from the ending, Alice (Milla Jovovich) pulls out the running scene as one of the Umbrella Corp's choppers shoots after her and shatters the glass behind her, while displaying her on a targeting monitor. As she escapes and jumps to safety, she is surprised by more guards. She drops her gun just about to surrender, but then falls down, grabs the gun and shoots all three of them. This entire scene is made after the intro of Resident Evil: Code: Veronica X game, with exception that Claire shot at the explosive behind the soldiers and didn't just mow them down with her gun.\n\nSales\n\nAccording to publisher Capcom, Resident Evil: Code: Veronica X has sold 1.4 million copies worldwide since its initial release (as of June 30, 2016).\n\nAwards\nGame Informer Magazine\nAugust 2001 (Issue 100).- voted #69 in the Top 100 Games of All Time poll\n\nInformation also contributed by MAT, MegaMegaMan and Xoleras\n\n More"

You start off as Bruce McGivern, a US government agent sent to stop Morpheus D. Duvall from spreading the zombie T-virus any further. Along the way you'll run into Fongling, a Chinese government agent who is aboard the cruise ship for the same reason, and you'll also end up playing as her. All you really need to know is that there are zombies and you have to kill them.\n\nYou'll pick up several different guns through the course of the game, including a magnum, a shotgun, and an assault rifle, but like in other Resident Evil games, zombies are difficult to put down permanently, and ammo can be very scarce.",

It is a port of an arcade game.\n\nAs in the original Code: Veronica game, Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside must escape Rockfort Island, which is infested with zombies. In this case however, the game can be played either with the Guncon 2 lightgun or with the standard controller as a first-person shooter. Players can choose either character or can play cooperatively as both.\n\nAs in most lightgun games, the object is to make it through an environment while shooting enemies. It is somewhat less typical in that you have full roaming control over your character rather than being stuck on rails. More unusually, a timer begins as you enter each area. If the timer runs out before you leave, Nemesis will appear and chase you.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nLicensing\n\nThe original creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi had to get the license back from SEGA in order to issue the Xbox 360 version of the game, even though he created the game at the time. That is because video games created for a company are usually considered \"work for hire\".\n\nPause Menu\n\nAn undocumented feature for the PS2 release of the game is that while you are in the pause menu during gameplay, you can press triangle and square together and the pause menu will disappear allowing you to see the game behind it.\n\nDreamcast Version\n\nRez was released on the Dreamcast, months before the PlayStation 2 release took place. It's not widely known that it was ever released on the former platform - both SEGA and UGA officially mention the PS2 release only. This is very likely due to the fact that SEGA discontinued the Dreamcast months before the release of Rez. As a result, there was no American release of Rez on the Dreamcast, and there was no real publicity surrounding the European release either, making it a hard-to-find title.\n\nThe Dreamcast version is relatively rare today, especially because the game suffered from many defective pressings. The risk of ending up with a non-working copy of the game is therefore something to be considered when prowling eBay or other online auction sites.\n\nBeta Soundtrack\n\nOn 2003, July 31st, a private Rez event occurred in Tokyo, where the team showed new game content to a few selected people. One of the levels was based on Fat Boy Slim music, but never made it into the game due to licensing reasons.\n\nA leaked beta version of the game also contains a list of artists whose music was meant to be implemented at that point in development, including Underworld, Aphex Twin, and The Chemical Brothers.\n\nWassily Kandinsky\n\nAt the end of the credits, Rez is quoted to be \"dedicated to the incredible creative soul of Kandinsky\".\n\nAbstract artist and composer Wassily Kandinsky was a synaesthete (a person with the neurological condition in which two or more senses mingle into one), meaning he was able to 'see' music and 'hear' color. He described his works as quoted:\n\n\"I applied streaks and blobs of color onto the canvas with a palette knife and I made them sing with all the intensity I could...\"\n\nThe nature of Rez's audiovisual experience and the references to synaesthetia are obviously linked to Kandinsky, as well as the working title, K-Project.\n\nTrance Vibrator\n\nThe Japanese Playstation 2 version was also sold as a limited edition box, bundled with the Trance Vibrator - an additional (external) Rumble Pack whose name left little to be desired of the imagination.\n\n1001 Video Games\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of Rez HD appears in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die by General Editor Tony Mott.\n\nMorolian\n\nOne of the player forms you can unlock for the \"Beyond\" levels is simply called \"Morolian\". This is an alien invader from UGA's previous game, Space Channel 5.\n\nTitle\n\nThe game's title has a threefold meaning. It was taken from the song \"Rez\" by Underworld, and can also be read as a shortening of the word \"resolve\". Tetsuya Mizuguchi has also stated that the title is a reference to the film Tron, in which death in the virtual world is referred to as being \"de-rezzed\". Mizuguchi reasoned that if \"de-rezzing\" means death or dispersement, \"rezzing\" would therefore equate to bringing something to life or combining separate elements into a whole, both of which can be tied into the game's synesthesia theme.\n\nScrapped Concepts\n\nRez went through several design concepts during development. At one point, the player avatar was meant to be seated in a large chair with woofer speakers, and the soundtrack was intended to be mainly hip-hop. Another stage during development had the avatar as a less abstract human form who walked on the ground instead of floating. Another proposed aesthetic for the game was based heavily on water and microscopic organisms.\n\nInformation also contributed by glidefan, Apogee IV, Bock, Sciere, and FatherJack.\n\n More"

        "description": "20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the \"Japan War\", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.\n\nRing of Red is a turn-based strategy game set in an alternative post-World War II Japan. Players take the role of members of the South Japan military who are put on a hunt for a stolen AFW. During battles, mechs are moved into position on a grid-based map and may engage different enemy units or occupy specific points. As turns are taken, time passes, shifting the battlefield through daytime and nighttime hours as well as different weather effects. All of these affect the accuracy of weapons as well as the types of abilities that can be used. Battles end when objectives are met by either side.\n\nPutting a twist on the turn-based genre, Ring of Red features turn-based movements with real-time combat. When two AFWs engage on the battle grid, players are taken to a real-time battle where they have limited time to engage one another before refueling is required. Here the AFW is viewed from 3rd person and may be moved forward and back and given orders. The AFW uses a steam powered cannon which must be pressurized before firing, aiming at either an enemy AFW or at enemy support crew. Accuracy increases continuously while in aiming mode, and the player may then issue a fire command, which launches an attack with the current accuracy shown on-screen. Additionally AFWs can engage in close combat if they are close enough, delivering punches to one another. Each AFW pilot also has his own statistics and own special abilities, that can be used only once per battle, that can be called upon at any time. AFWs also feature unique statistics, being divided into four types: Standard, Light, 4-Leg (Heavy) and Anti-AFW.\n\nEach AFW unit is actually a group made up of three ground units: one of which acts as crew for the AFW, while the other two walk alongside. Support units are divided into types including: Infantry, Shooter, Supply, Medical, Mechanic and Recon. Each of these types of \"support units\" has different skills in battle and individually have different abilities and statistics. The abilities available and used change depending on which positions the units are assigned to. Additionally many special abilities need to \"charge\" in the rear ranks before becoming available for usage. These abilities include firing special types of munitions (including flash, heat, smoke and impact), laying down mines or tripwire, laying down a barrage of fire, throwing grenades, healing units, sniping specific targets, morale boosts, AFW repairs, neutralization of enemy effects and disarming enemy mines/tripwire.",

South Japan is controlled by the West (including ex-Nazis), whereas North Japan is controlled by Russia. This scenario was apparently thought to be too offensive for a US or European release so that the story was bowdlerized considerably (to the point of not making any sense). For example, the connections of South Japan (the player's side) to the (ex-)Nazis that were explained in the Japanese version, are not mentioned at all, just as there are no references to the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima (that nevertheless also took place in Ring of Red's alternate history)."

In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.\n\nSeveral gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.\n\nAs with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:",

Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear.\n\nRobocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets.

Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.\n\nObjectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested.

        "description": "Robot Warlords is a one or two player, turn based, strategy game featuring battling robots in real Tokyo settings.\n\nThe background story, which is a single player game, is one of political unrest and intrigue, at least that's what it says in the game description. The Japanese army is attempting a military takeover, groups of them have declared martial law and are riding around in robots called Bullets to enforce it. The government doesn't want to launch an all out counter attack because that would result in massive civilian casualties. Instead they turn to Professor Matsuzakai who developed the Bullet machines and a handful of people at the Odaiba Bullet repair site. With major Kazuma Saeki in charge Operation Velvet is launched, with only four operational experimental machines at their disposal they must stop the rebellion in seven days otherwise an all out attack will be launched against the rebel forces in Tokyo with corresponding catastrophic loss of life and massive damage.\n\nThe game starts with a long conversation between the chief cabinet secretary, the head of the army and the Japanese Prime minister, This sets the scene and introduces all the characters. When this is over the player starts on their first mission. Prior to a mission each of the Bullets can be customised, this includes naming and changing the colour of each machine, assigning weapons to each arm and shoulder, and upgrading body parts. The player also has a number of TP or Technique points which they can use to install battle manoeuvres such as the 'Preparation For Combat' technique which costs three TP and decreases the enemy weapon hit ratio by -20 and the player's hit ratio by -10. Only six techniques can be installed at a time.\n\nThe game consists of eleven missions spread over a seven day period and each mission is turn based. In each turn the player selects whether they wish to move a Bullet in normal mode, just a few adjacent cells, or turbo mode in which they can travel further. While moving they may optionally employ one of the deployed combat techniques. Once the player has set their Bullet's destination they may choose whether or not to attack their opponents, in an attack multiple opponents can be selected. While various battle techniques used by the players and their opponents affect the hit ratio and consequently the damage caused by an attack, other game elements also do this. When firing through obstacles such as cars the hit ratio is halved, if the line of fire passes through two cars it is halved again and nothing gets through three cars. There are also special cells known as obstruction squares which halve the hit rate of any firing line that passes through them.\n\nWhen the player has completed the game in Story mode the game changes to Life mode where, the manual states, \"A new stage is formed for every mission, so it is necessary to come up with differing strategies each time.\" In Life mode the player receives prize money for completed missions which they can use to trade for parts and weapons, trading is only available in Life mode. There is also a two player 'Vs' mode in which two team battle it out, this requires two controllers and is also turn based.",

Again these house robots are modelled on the ones that appear in the TV programs.\n\nBesides the UK arena, this initial launch has many new arenas including: North Sea Oilrig, Rooftops, Steel Works, Scrapyard, Dockyard and the Abandoned Military Base.\n\n'Real robots' are in the game such as Chaos 2 and Razer and many more. With these you can recreate your favorite battles against your friend on the same machine.",

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the Robotech cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game.\n\nAs the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.",

The game includes 3 modes of play: \"Challenge mode\", in which you have to construct a rollercoaster which accomplishes a set goal (like a thrill value above 100, safety above 50, maximum and minimum heights and so on), while avoiding to construct a device which will kill off all your visitors (as the ride goes on you get statistics on how people feel and if anyone has fallen off), \"Management mode\", which allows you to construct and run an entire amusement park, research new attractions and make sure you keep the money flowing, and a \"Quick Ride mode\", where you ride pre-built roller coasters.",

Naturally, just letting the guy continue being a loser isn't particularly interesting, so a spirit that happens to also live in his apartment starts to toy with his daily life.\n\nYou can affect Neji in two different ways. If he's not around, you can interact with things in his apartment like moving his table, or locking his door. If he is around, you can throw little ping-pong balls at objects to focus his attention on them. If you throw too many too fast, though, he'll get depressed and ignore you.\n\nThe game follows a calendar with different missions to do on different days. Each mission in the game starts with a short video showing what you need to get Neji to do, which can be something simple like making him use his computer or drink a glass of water, or something more complicated like getting him to order something from a TV ad. Depending on your success in each mission, the outcome will change, and you will determine if Neji remains a loser for the rest of his life.",

        "description": "Asami Onohara is in most ways an average high-school girl; cheerful, outgoing, and just a bit clumsy. She has a secret, though: she's married to her physics teacher! Apart from her parents, nobody but the two of them know, and if they want to stay together, it needs to stay that way until she graduates.\n\nRoommate Asami is a spinoff of Datam Polystar's Roommate series based on the manga Okusama wa Joshik\u014dsei (My Wife is a High School Student) by Hiyoko Kobayashi. The game proceeds in standard visual novel fashion from point of view of the teacher, who must be named by the player. Each day is broken up into four segments, and at certain times it is possible to visit different locations around the city, which will cause different events to occur. During conversations, there are often points where the player must choose from multiple responses, which will affect the flow of the story and potentially lead toward different endings.\n\nThe Dreamcast \"Director's Edition\" features higher-resolution CG images and includes a bonus disc with drama tracks and voice data, but is otherwise identical.",

Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.",

All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell.\n\nThe game encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter. You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened. Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small \"grunt\" type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you. Each has it's own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge.\n\nIn a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn't much puzzle solving and not much slow times. The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title. When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it's either killed or blocked, and running is often the only option. You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.",

This fantasy themed game has a wide range of features, that provide a robust single player game, split-screen multiplayer, and special modes, missions, and creatures that can be unlocked.\n\nThe story of Savage Skies centers around the death of a powerful king struck down by the demons of a vengeful necromancer banished from the kingdom years earlier. With the king's soul magically shattered, and the land in turmoil, the player is challenged to restore the throne by winning the war for one of three factions in the game - the noble Virtwyn, the mutated Chrysalis, or the necromantic Pariah. Mission based animations and voiceovers provide the story elements to the player as the game unfolds.\n\nGameplay borrows loosely from other 3D aerial combat/shooter games like Starfighter, Flying Hereos and DragonStrike, but has it's own twists, like advanced super maneuvers and power-ups. Core to Savage Skies is the ability to unlock and try many different creatures (up to 24) in both the single and multiplayer portions of the game. Each creature has strengths and weaknesses like speed, manuverability, offensive and defensive powers, that can be leveraged during the campaign missions.\n\nSavage Skies also features fun 2 player split screen action with 7 unique multiplayer maps and 3 multiplayer modes.",

        "description": "Phantasy Star - Generation:1 is a remake of Phantasy Star. The remake retains many cardinal aspects of the original, including story, characters, basic battle system, and first-person 3D dungeon navigation. However, the remake has a noticeably more linear progression, generally not allowing free-roaming and exploring locations outside of the order prescribed by the plot. Typically, specific dialogues are now needed to trigger an event that would lead the player to the next destination. Instead of one dungeon key that allows exploring any dungeon, each one has a particular key that has to be obtained in a unique fashion. Also, several locations that were optional in the original game are now mandatory.\n\nThere are some gameplay-related changes and additions: there are more weapons, more levels to gain for the characters, additional items and spells, as well as combo attacks which can be performed by equipping various crystals in addition to a specific weapon. Other changes include updated graphics (pre-rendered for towns and overworld, real-time 3D for dungeons), as well as more dialogue and characterization. It is now possible to talk to companions and engage in longer and more varied conversations with the NPCs in towns.",

        "description": "Making its PlayStation debut, SEGA's third title in their arcade fishing series Sega Bass Fishing Duel saw fulfillment of a promise it had not been able to keep with the previous games: now players can go head-to-head against one another with the split-screen versus mode. Exclusive to PlayStation 2 and released a year after Bass Fishing 2 on Dreamcast, Duel is essentially an expanded port of the Dreamcast sequel. There are three modes including Tournament, Practice and the new VS mode. A wide variety of environments, tackle and fish are included - some unique to this title.",

        "description": "Yuri Hyuga is a young harmonixer: a man who possesses the power of transforming into demons. He meets Alice Elliot, a young British girl whose father was brutally murdered, and who is chased by a mysterious warlock who calls himself Roger Bacon. Yuri and Alice travel through pre-war China, dealing with demons, evil magicians, and the Japanese occupation army. The journey eventually takes them and their friends to Europe, where they have to confront their ultimate enemy, but also uncover the truth about their own pasts.\n\nShadow Hearts is a Japanese-style role-playing game set in a historical period (China and Europe of 1913, one year before World War I) with plenty of supernatural elements mixed in. The game shares plot-related and stylistic traits with Koudelka, to which it can be considered a sequel. The player navigates a party of characters (up to three active combatants) over pre-rendered backgrounds. Combat with regular enemies occurs randomly. During battles, characters use regular attacks or cast spells. In addition to the regular health (HP) and magic points (MP), each character also has a special SP (\"sanity points\") bar. The sanity bar is gradually depleted in combat; when characters run out of SP, they become insane and hence uncontrollable, until their sanity is restored with items.\n\nThe game implements traditional turn-based combat style for the battles, adding to it a feature called Judgment Ring. Every time a character performs an attack, a ring with a spinning arrow appears on the top of the screen. If the player stops the arrow when it is over a critical area on the ring, the attack will be more powerful. However, missing the larger hit area will cancel the attack completely. Various types of attacks have rings of various difficulty; usually, the more powerful a spell is, the smaller the hit area is on the ring. The Judgment Ring is also used for other purposes; it can help the player reduce prices in stores, and is needed to solve several puzzles.\n\nAll characters except Yuri learn new abilities automatically when leveling up. Due to his demon-fusion abilities, Yuri can collect soul energy and use it to acquire various fusion forms. When Yuri transforms into a demon he gains unique abilities, and continues fighting with the party as a controllable character. He also has to travel to a graveyard in his own mental realm from time to time, in order to face his own inner demons and clear Malice, negative vengeful energy the party accumulates by killing enemies.",

Suddenly, a tremendous blow darkens the sight of his eyes, and the next thing he can see is a very strange room filled with bizarre objects, and a voice talking to him from nowhere. A mysterious being known as Homunculus tells Eike that he has been stabbed to death. Homunculus gives Eike a time-travelling device and brings him back to life a short while before his murder took place. From that moment on, Eike's miraculously acquired second chance turns into a constant race against time, as he tries to escape from his destiny. In order to alter the course of events, preventing the unknown person from carrying out his murder, Eike will have to travel back in time as far as the 16th century, meeting people closely connected to his own existence and changing the fabric of reality.\n\nShadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town. If Eike fails to achieve the goal at hand within the allotted time and prevent his murder, the chapter must be restarted.\n\nDuring the course of the game the player will have several choices and opportunities to change the future in various ways. Due to the time-traveling feature, many objectives can be accomplished in non-linear ways, branching the storyline and eventually resulting in eight different endings, six of which can be achieved during the first playthrough, and two others unlocked after having reached the other six.",

Years have passed and the kingdom was completely destroyed, save for a mysterious citadel in the midst of a dangerous forest. A young explorer travels there and discovers the entrance. However, once inside the citadel, a strange old man seals the doors, trapping the explorer and compelling him to climb to the top of the gigantic structure in order to escape.\n\nShadow Tower: Abyss is a sequel to Shadow Tower. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person action role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling and a setting that mixes medieval fantasy with horror. Most of the elements distinguishing the previous game have been carried over, including survival-oriented mechanics with features such as weapons gradually deteriorating when used in battles. As opposed to the first game, the player character can wield guns such as pistols, sniper rifles, etc., though ammunition is comparatively scarce. It is also possible to switch between firearms and melee weapons during combat, as well as target specific body parts of the enemies.\n\nThe protagonist collects souls while exploring areas and defeating monsters. These souls gradually increase his strength, allowing him to inflict more damage. Most other parameters, however, are upgraded by finding, consuming, or equipping various items. Weapons proficiency is divided into break, pierce and slash categories. Compared to the predecessor, the sequel has a larger variety of areas, its citadel hosting entire cavern systems and even underground forests.",

        "description": "An ordinary Tokyo high-school student sees a strange dream. A mysterious woman warns him of an upcoming destruction, in which the sins of humanity will be purged. She tells him that her name is Yuko Takao. When the young man comes to his senses, he realizes that he is in the subway, on the way to Yoyogi Park, where he intends to meet his classmates and visit their sick teacher, Yuko Takao, in a hospital. Yoyogi Park appears to be off limits: recent riots have already claimed several victims, and Hikawa, the top executive of Cybers Communication, is missing.\n\nThe student heads to the hospital and meets his classmates; however, the hospital is overrun by demons shortly afterwards. After having fought his way to the roof, the studentwitnesses the Conception - a colossal destruction of the city, which destroys the world as we know it. Only the hero, two of his classmates, and a few other humans have survived. The rest of the world is populated by demons, and the hero is transformed into a demon himself. He must communicate with the demonic inhabitants of this horrifying realm, find out what happened to his classmates, and ultimately shape the future of the world.\n\nShin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne is the third installment in the main series of the Megami Tensei universe. The game retains many traditional elements of the series. Like in the previous entries, the player navigates a character over a large map of a post-apocalyptic city, accessing and exploring complex, maze-like dungeons, which are viewed from a third-person perspective in this installment. Enemy encounters are random, and combat is turn-based. Demon conversation and fusion features from the previous games have been preserved, and function similarly. The player may opt for engaging in a dialogue with demons during the battle, selecting responses and recruiting the demon into the party if it is pleased by them. Demons can be then fused in specific locations to create more powerful ones.\n\nThe active party includes four characters, as opposed to six in the previous games in the series, and contains no human characters whatsoever. Being a demon himself, the protagonist does not use weapons; instead of equipping armor, he ingests symbiotic creatures known as Magatama. Various types of Magatama affect the hero's parameters, strengths and weaknesses to particular elements or attack types, and teach him magic and special abilities. When the protagonist levels up, the player can manually increase his parameters. Leveling up also allows the hero to learn the abilities contained within the Magatama. Once an ability is learned, a different Magatama can be equipped, but the player can still retain the mastered ability and use it in battles. The hero can use up to eight different abilities in a battle.\n\nA new feature called \"Press Turn\" has been added to the combat system. Each demon has certain resistances, immunities, and weaknesses to different elements or attack types. By using an ability of a type that the enemy is weak to, the player not only inflicts extra damage, but also gains an additional turn. These turns can be used in succession by continuously exploiting enemy weaknesses; naturally, enemies can do the same to player-controlled characters. This feature shifts combat challenge to tactical preparations and memorization of enemy properties, and encourages creation of balanced parties with a varied arsenal of abilities.\n\nThe Law and Chaos ideologies and alignments are absent from this installment. The Vortex World, in which the hero of the game finds himself, is conceived by its creators as an intermediate period leading to a new world order. The nature of this order must be defined by the few surviving human beings, who alone have the capacity of forming new ideologies. Being a demon, the player character is unable to shape his own ideology; however, he can choose to join forces with one, or oppose all of them. There are many instances during which the player is prompted to make choices, steering the main character towards a certain ideology, eventually branching the storyline and leading to one of the five possible endings.",

There are four leagues with increasing difficulty and six races each - to get access to the next league the player has to be number one in average after all six races. But there is one special gimmick: the shox zones. There are three of those zones per race and the player has to drive through them as fast as possible. If he gets the gold medal in all three a shock wave manifests which makes controlling the car difficult - the goal is to stay in touch with this wave as long as possible. All those accomplishments reward money which is reinvested into new cars (which are divided into four classes).

        "description": "The player is cast in the role of James Sunderland, an at first sight normal person who got confused, as anyone else would, when he received a letter from his wife asking him to come to Silent Hill, their special place. The only problem is that his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter's request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As James reaches the outskirts of the town, he finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill and his own past.\n\nSilent Hill 2 is a survival horror game. The gameplay is similar to that of the first installment. The player navigates James around the town of Silent Hill and collects weapons, health-restoring items, and objects needed to solve puzzles in an unlimited inventory. A radio alerts James when enemies are near. Like the protagonist of the first game, James is not very skillful in combat; he can fight with basic melee weapons or firearms with scarce ammunition. Most of the puzzles are logic-based and are often shaped like riddles, though there are a few simple inventory-based tasks as well.\n\nWhile the basic concept is the same as in the previous entry, the game is set in a part of town that was unexplored in it, and the weapons and enemies are mostly new as well. Also new is the ability to change the standard \"survival horror\" (character-dependent) controls into the more widespread, 3D (camera-dependent) navigation. The difficulty level can be adjusted separately for combat and puzzles.",

One fine day she goes shopping, but suddenly finds herself trapped in a strange, terrifying place - the eerie town Silent Hill. She hears footsteps; disgusting, creepy monsters attack her, and she has to defend herself. Exploring Silent Hill - and her own past - Heather must find a way to escape the dreadful town.\n\nThe third installment in the Silent Hill series is similar to its predecessor visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous entries, it is a survival horror game combining action-based (predominantly close-ranged) combat and puzzle-solving. The game is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding installments. Heather is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative ineptitude in combat.",

When she gets out of said diner, we can see its name: \"Happy Burger\". In Silent Hill 2 there was a local called Happy Burger, in the corner of Sanders St. and Neely St.\nTwo of the stores encountered in the mall are named after women from Goethe's Faust: Boutique Marguerite and Helen's Bakery.\nNear the end of the game, the player will encounter areas identical to the end of Silent Hill.

When playing the game with a Silent Hill 2 save game on the memory card, other references appear:\nIn the Mall, you are given the option to retrieve something from a dirty toilet. When doing so, Heather will crouch and hesitantly move her hand towards the toilet, accompanied with suspense music. At the last moment she comes to her senses, turns to the camera and says \"Gross. Who would do something like that anyway?\". (In Silent Hill 2, the player had to retrieve a wallet from a clogged toilet).\nWhen examining your mailbox in the apartment building, Heather comments that there is no mail, not \"even from a dead wife\". Silent Hill 2 starts with the player receiving a letter from his wife who has been dead for three years.\nWhen examining the fence on the roof of Brookhaven Hospital, Heather says \"it doesn't look like it's about to break\".

        "description": "One summer night, six high-school students have gathered at an old abandoned building at their school. Looking to have a little fun before school starts again in the fall, they enter the building looking for ghosts and to tell a few scary stories. But just after they enter, an earthquake hits their town, causing the building to collapse and leaving the students trapped beneath the building. Searching for a way out, they discover that they just may have found the ghosts they were looking for, who are none too happy about these unwanted guests...\n\nHy\u014dry\u016b Sh\u014djo (Drifting Girl) is a combination of a Japanese-style visual novel \"gal game\" and a horror game. Each day, the player must ration food for each of their companions -- all of them girls from the protagonist's school -- then choose a partner to go out and search for supplies and information, while doing their best to avoid or fight off the spirits haunting the ruins. Each character needs a certain amount of food each day; if they have too little, their health will deplete until they are incapacitated and eventually die. Investigation is command based, with the options to move to other locations, investigate the current area more closely, or converse with the player's current partner.\n\nEach partner has a specific talent which affects investigation. For example, one girl is skilled at finding food, while another is able to sense the presence of ghosts. Choosing a girl for the search partner also allows the player to further their romantic relationship with that character, and the game's ending will change depending on which characters are left alive at the conclusion, and which girl the player has forged the strongest bond with.",

Because of air piracy and other dangers, the occupation of Skygunners have appeared. Part freelancer and part mercenary, they are often hired for their daring skills in the air. Ciel and Copain are two such Skygunners, relaxing at the town of Rive. The police chief of Rive asks the two gunners to act as security for the town's scientific expo, and assigns his agent Femme to the group as well. What seems like a simple babysitting task soon turns to adventure when the criminal scientific genius, Ventre shows up, with his gang of loyal Poulet doll-henchmen. As Ventre orchestrates the theft of the Eternal Engine, a perpetual motion machine that could forever power his inventions, it's up to Ciel, Copain and Femme to take to the skies and foil Ventre's plans.\n\nSkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: \"Look Targeting\" and \"Weapon Lock\". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.\n\nThe primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.",

When he was a kit, a gang called the Fiendish Five killed his family and divided up their book on the art of thieving: the Thievius Raccoonus. Sly must defeat all the members of the gang to recover the book while evading Carmelita Fox, a police officer chasing him around the world to apprehend him.\n\nThis game is divided into five worlds, each themed around a particular part of the world and the villain headquartered there. Most worlds are structured as a central hub with entrances to numerous individual levels. Each of the levels has a primary goals which earns you a key. You must collect all the keys in the world to fight the world's boss.\n\nMany of the levels have a platformer structure. The objective of these worlds is to reach the location of the key. There are substantial stealth elements here as you must dodge searchlights and trips lasers which set off alarms and avoid alerting guards. In addition to the main objective, there are clue bottles to find. Finding all the clues in a level allows you to open a safe with a page from the Thievius Raccoonus which grants a new ability of some sort. After getting this, there is also a master thief sprint where you must get from the start of a level to the exit within a time limit.\n\nThere are also mini-game levels which could be kart-style racing, several varieties of shooter or assorted other tasks, such as collecting objects before your enemies do.\n\nBoss fights also run to several styles, ranging from platforming, to more straightforward combat to puzzles to rhythm to shooter.\n\nAll artwork is done in a cel-shaded style and dialogue is fully voiced.",

This is most visible in the intro and ending cinematics, which are fully animated instead of using limited flash sequences like in the international versions. There is also a slight dialogue difference, with Carmelita counting down her \"10 second head start\" instead of Sly. The PAL version has both cutscenes available when unlocked, while the North American version only has the Japanese intro.\n\nFurthermore, the Japanese release has a 3-minute demo of the game with the vocal song Blackjack that appears after 30 seconds of the player's inactivity in the main menu.\n\nUtah inaccuracy\n\nMesa City, the location of level two of the game is portrayed as being in Utah.

Since you have these illegal things in your possession, you are a prime target. A target by law enforcement, a target by rival smugglers and gang, a target by more militaristic forces of the United States.\n\nIf you can survive the high speed chases, the off-road evasion, the gunfire and the dust... you stand to make quite a profit. Maybe enough to outfit your vehicle for your next smuggling endeavor. Something that will make the next run a little less hazardous.\n\nAltogether there are over 30 missions inside of 3 distinct and vast environments. Vast in the full sense of the word, in that you can drive literally anywhere with the game's areas... and get lost doing it too. This style of gameplay is a staple of the Smuggler's Run series and Grand Theft Auto 3 or Vice City",

These can be compared with the players of other teams in graded performances.\n\nA special feature of the game is that the controls can be changed so that most actions are bound to the same button. The game itself will then evaluate which action is most appropriate for the current situation.\n\nThe game comes with variable weather effects, and realistically digitalized players.",

She later found out that Sega went ahead and made the game anyway, with the lead character Ulala bearing a strong resemblance to her.\n\nShe ultimately lost the suit and a later appeal. Lady Miss Kier was then liable to pay Sega's legal fees of $608,000 (reduced from the $763,000 requested).\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nTowards the end of the game, Ulala encounters a character named Space Michael, who is actually (and obviously) none other than Michael Jackson. And speaking of Jacko, he also teamed with Sega in the early 90s to produce a Sega Genesis game called Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, based on a very obscure movie he wrote and starred in. Maybe that old relationship with Sega is what got him slipped in with Ulala and her crew in SC5.\n\nPlaystation 2 version\n\nThe Playstation 2 version featured less compressed FMV footage and less vibrant colors then that of the original Dreamcast version.\n\nInformation also contributed by Guy Chapman and shifter\n\n More"

        "description": "25 years after Space Invaders was released, Taito has decided to bring us a special anniversary edition that includes all the versions of Space Invaders that were ever released in the arcades, plus two extra game modes. These include:Space Invaders* - monochrome version: The original, as first appeared in 1978. Move your ship left or right, shooting at oncoming invaders, while dodging theirs. Shoot the flying saucer that goes across the screen for extra points. Four barriers protect you from invaders' shots, but will be destroyed after several hits. Once you shoot every invader on screen, you have to do it again and again. The game ends when all lives are lost.\n\nSpace Invaders - color version: Same version as above, but in color.\n\nSpace Invaders - cellophane version: Five strips of cellophane (cyan, green, yellow, blue, red) are placed across the game screen, in an attempt to block out the two black areas.\n\nSpace Invaders - upright version: Space Invaders in color, but a background has been added, and contains a planet and some stars.\n\nSpace Invaders doubles: Two players can play at the same time. Lives are separate, so if one players loses all their lives, the other keeps on playing.\n\nSpace Invaders Part II: Known as Space Invaders Deluxe in the US. The differences between the original and this game is that there are two different flying saucers: one is steadily visible and another blinks. Different points are awarded for each one that is killed. Also, from wave two onwards, invaders can be split into two when shot, and the flying saucers drop alien reinforcements. Also available as a cocktail cabinet.\n\nSpace Invaders VS: Two-player game. The screen is split is split into two, with each side reserved for each player. Invaders occupy both sides. The object of the game is to kill these invaders, so that you can destroy the ship at the top of the screen that belongs to your opponent. Matches are determined before the start of the game. You can have a CPU opponent.\n\nSpace Invaders 3D: Everything on screen appears in 3D. Instead of bullets, not only do invaders shoot arrows at you, but they can launch fireballs at you. You lose a life when you come in contact with these. As always, flying saucers go across the screen, but will then fly directly toward you. When these saucers are hit, you automatically receive a power-up that will help you kill the invaders.\n\nBefore you start each game, you can adjust the view of which you can play. One view shows the cabinet as it is played as if you are standing in front of the machine itself, while another allows you to play the game in full-screen mode. The sounds of Space Invaders serves as the background music, but this can be changed to music from various Taito games, such as Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Darius, and several others. Other options let you choose the number of lives to start off with and adjust the number of points needed to gain extra lives.\n\nAlong with the games, you can also view promotional material, as well as any development sheets for the original game.",

One section, called simply \"Mini-game\", allows you to shoot at spaceships flying around the space station. Another section, \"Morning Musume TVDJ\", reuses the system from Sony's earlier PS2 game TVDJ and allows the player to reedit and add effects to several of the group's music videos in real-time.

One code allowed you to play the game as Mary Jane (the only female playable character), but this code was apparently disabled in later production copies of the game. A possible reason for this is that in the game's ending you see Mary Jane and your character kissing, so if you play as Mary Jane you end up with her frenching herself. Perhaps the developers felt that having two women making out in their game would alienate potential buyers (or, more likely, the parents of potential buyers), considering the family demographic this game is targeted at. Also, In the PC version of the game, two cheat codes, one that made you have big head and feet and another that made your character tiny-sized, are disabled by the 1.1 patch to the game. The reason for this is unknown, possibly to improve game stability or something like that.\n\nXbox version\n\nIn the Xbox version of this game, there are two extra levels where you fight Kraven the Hunter that isn't in the PS2, Gamecube, or PC versions.\n\nInformation also contributed by Alan Chan\n\n More"

Unfortunately the Bogeyman steals the souls of their friends and turns them into stone - of course the two heroes have to get them back. So they visit the Land of Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted house and the lab of a mad scientist.\n\nThe player can switch instantly (but limited because it costs crystals which can be found in the levels) between the two characters which is often needed to progress in the game: both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is disguised as a witch, is invulnerable to ice and can shrink herself. Greg on the other hand is the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a super jump. Both have the same basic fighting abilities: hitting an enemy or jumping on their head kills them - but the same goes for the two kids which die with the first hit. Besides the fighting the game consists of platforming and simple puzzles. The game is in 3D but there is one linear path to follow (with a few junctions).",

Universal Interactive refused to give the team an extension and released the game in this state, with the team being forced to rework the Ripto miniboss into the final boss of the game.\n\nUnused Content\n\nThe game was originally intended to have a third type of breath that Spyro could breathe, music notes.

Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races.\n\nWith challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.",

The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include \"behind-the-scenes\" footage and a \"making of\" segment.",

The planet was attacked by a mysterious fleet, though Fayt managed to escape. After being saved by a space ship, Fayt landed on a planet called Vanguard, with a much more primitive civilization than his own. From this medieval world, Fayt, Sophia, and their friends begin their interstellar quest to find out the cause of the attack on Hyda, and much more.\n\nThis is the third installment in Enix's Star Ocean science fiction role-playing series. The game utilizes the combat system that made Star Ocean games different: unlike most Japanese party RPGs, the battles are not turn-based, but real time. Players take control of the main character, Fayt, while his allies are controlled by the AI. Different AI behavior strategies can be assigned to the party members, such as being offensive or defensive.",

        "description": "On its course to the Alpha Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager is attacked by an unknown ship and is transported to a graveyard of ships with a giant space station in the middle. The player is Ensign Alex Munro (male or female, according to the player's choice), second in command of the newly formed Hazard Team, an elite force of Voyager security personnel. It's up to the player and your team to find out why the Voyager was brought here and to find a way to escape. To do so, they will have to complete several missions on different ships and space stations.\n\nStar Trek: Voyager - Elite Force is a first-person shooter that uses the Quake III engine. The different types of missions range from pure combat to stealth missions. The enemies include many well-known Star Trek races like the Borg or the Klingons, but also other alien races and creatures invented specifically for this game. All the weapons have a futuristic design, ranging from the low-damage hand phaser to stasis weapons and grenade launchers. The weapons either gradually recharge ammunition automatically, or require ammunition that can be collected from other weapons or terminals.\n\nThough the player directly controls only Munroe, up to three teammates usually accompany him (or her) during the missions and fight the enemies, controlled by the AI. Scripted events and cutscenes often involve actions committed by these teammates. When not on a mission, Munroe can explore the space ship, talking to characters directly or overhearing their conversations with each other. A few decisions can be made by the player during the course of the game, which may influence the subsequent events.\n\nA multiplayer mode called \"Holomatch\" is also available.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nActors\nWhen the game was first released, Jeri Ryan wasn't available to do the voice-overs, and a sound-alike was used. All other TV cast members contributed their own voice to their cyber-counterparts. Jeri's voice was added in the latest official V1.2 patch.\nDevon Raymond, the woman who does the voice for Alexandria Munroe, also appears in the Voyager TV series finale as a cadet.\nAI\n\nIn the Gamasutra Postmortem for Elite Force, the developers note the challenges behind tweaking the PC-controlled Elite Force members' AI. Initially, the Elite Force was too good, killing most of the enemies and leaving little for the player to do. Then they made the team less effective, but this resulted in the enemies killing them off unless the player protected them. The solution was to have the Elite Force be less effective, but have the enemies target the player more than the rest of the team.\n\nCharacters\n\nWhile most of the hazard team characters were invented specifically for the game, Chell the paranoid bolian is actually a minor character from the Voyager TV show who appears in the episodes \"Repression\" and \"Learning Curve\". He's also played by the same guy who does his voice in the game.\n\nCut content\n\nAs told by project lead Brian Pelletier, originally if you left Foster to be assimilated by the Borg, he would appear in the end to help you fight the Forge Boss (in fact, the Borg were supposed to help you anyway) however this final team-up was scrapped from the game at the last moment because of time constraints and AI problems, so Foster had to go.\n\nDesktop\n\nThe game actually installs two icons to your desktop: one for the single-player campaign, and a separate icon for the multi-player Holomatch.\n\nDevelopment\n\nBecause of Paramount licensing requirements, The game was developed so none of the TV characters would be killed. Raven opted to create the Elite Force in compliance of the requirement.\n\nFriendly fire\n\nIf you fire on a fellow officer, you'll quickly find yourself being targeted by numerous other personnel. If you actually survive the attack for 30 seconds, you are shown to be in the brig, being lectured by a cast member. The cast members actually follow a list, so if you quicksave before you kill a shipmate, you can hear all the crew members lecture you about your criminal actions.\n\nReferences\nDuring the \"R & R\" mission, after visiting the mess hall, you can visit your quarters. Inside, you'll find a PADD with \"Vulcan Love Slave 3: P'orn Farr\" as the content... No, you can't really read it.\nSome members of the Elite Force are named after employees of Raven. For example, Rick Biessman is named after Eric Biessman, who did Holomatch Level Design for the game. Other examples include Odell, Foster and Munro.\nThe alternate federation you encounter mid-game is taken from the \"Mirror, Mirror\" episode of the original Star Trek series, in which captain Kirk got trapped in an alternate universe where the federation is actually an evil dictatorial conglomerate.\nSexuality\n\nWhether you play as a man or a woman, you end up being flirted with by a female character. This is almost certainly an oversight by the programmers, and is ironic as the Star Trek lineage has usually shied away from having overtly homosexual characters. The series' original creator Gene Roddenberry was reportedly in favor of the idea, note that the various Star Trek series have often been ahead of their time in having a multiracial cast. Other members of the staff (especially Executive Producer Rick Berman) had ruled against diverse orientations.\n\nAwards\nComputer Gaming World\nApril 2001 (Issue #201) \u2013 Best Opening Scene of the Year\nGameSpy\n2000 \u2013 Action Game of the Year\n2000 \u2013 Special Award for Best Use of a Franchise\nPC Player (Germany)\nIssue 01/2001 - Best Action Game in 2000\nIssue 01/2001 - Best Star Trek Game in 2000\n\nInformation also contributed by Alan Chan, Dr. Elementary, Istari, Kasey Chang, Martin Smith; Scott Monster, Terrence Bosky and Zovni\n\n More"

        "description": "Jango Fett is about to take on a project that could make or break his bounty hunting career, and his life. Chosen to be the blue-print for the Clone Army, Jango must now prove himself in order to gain the biggest job on the streets, wiping out the deadly cult, Bando Gora. Every other bounty hunter in the galaxy is willing and able to do the job, so you must work hard to gain the contract from Darth Tyranus.\n\nTo win the contract, you must complete a range of missions and collect the bounties on worlds very familiar to Star Wars fans. Jango has his trusty dual pistols to help him out, but also has the ability to use his flame thrower, jet pack, poison darts and much more. Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level. Jango must identify them with his helmet gear, and catch them alive...or dead. Bounties allow the player to unlock bonus materials.\n\nThe 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs. Bounty Hunter also connects to the movies in that it explains how Jango became the model for the Clone Army of the Republic, and how he became acquainted with Zam Wesell, who makes an appearance in the movies.",

Seeking payback for his humiliating loss, Sebulba has a new beefed-up Podracer and lust for revenge. But it's not going to be easy: Anakin has grown into a boldly skilled Podracer pilot.

Crash and bash competitors into oblivion as you take them out of the race for good. Get down and dirty against 16+ of the most aggressive Podracers in the galaxy and smash your opponents into twisted wreckage\n\nFeel the heat and roar of a horde of opponents on your tail--the turbo-charged Podracer AI means you're never on the track alone\n\nNew, never-before-seen characters and Podracers, plus a few of your old favorites\n\nRace to the finish in the Boonta Eve Classic or earn your place in the winner's circle on 13 devilishly challenging courses on four new planets, plus Tatooine\n\nMultiple game modes include practice, single play, tournament, time trials and versus\n\nDeveloped by Rainbow Studios, makers of the hit games Motocross Madness and ATV Off-Road Fury",

After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var. After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var. They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon. Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!\n\nThe Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.",

        "description": "Starsky & Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.\n\nLike the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky & Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.\n\nThe overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.\n\nDave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.",

        "description": "Steel Dragon EX consists of two shoot 'em up gamesShienryu (Steel Dragon*) - A port of the arcade and Sega Saturn game\n\nSteel Dragon Evolution gives the player a choice between three different space crafts and six different pilots. The pilots only determine the shot colour, while the crafts vary in speed and fire power. Up to two players can play simultaneously. The goal of the game is to progress far enough in each stage to beat the end boss, ultimately winning all levels.\n\nPlayers have only a limited amount of lives, however, extra lives can be obtained during the game. The main feature of Steel Dragon Evolution is that the main fire button is analogue. The more pressure is applied to the button, the heavier the fire power of the player's craft becomes. As a trade-off at the same time the craft's speed is reduced. Alternatively, three separate buttons for low, medium and heavy fire can be pressed.\n\nIf a player destroys an enemy, a multiplier is applied from 1x to 256x depending on how heavy the fire power applied was. However, some enemies drop stars which also have a multiplier of 1x to 256x attached to them. Here the scale is reversed, not firing at all while collecting the stars gives the highest multiplier.",

As you gain notoriety, you will get offers from big budget, Hollywood films, complete with large stunts and pyrotechnics.\n\nStuntman takes place in six different locations, each location shooting a different movie. There are four to eight different missions for each movie. Some will have you chasing a car around a harbor, to jumping between two trains, to jumping through windows. When a movie is complete, you can view a trailer of the movie, with your stunts worked into it.\n\nAside from the Career mode, you can choose to play various driving tests, such as Speed Tests, Precision Tests, and, of course, Stunt Tests. Stuntman also includes a stunt park editor, where you can place ramps, obstacles, and other equipment in an arena, and then choose to play it.\n\nAs a Stuntman, you get to drive a variety of cars, such as police cars, sports cars, trucks, and armored vehicles.\n\nStuntman can be informative, as well. Before each stunt, your character will describe what he has to do, and how important timing is. You can learn various techniques that real stunt drivers use, such as the cannon roll and the nitro boost. You can also learn what the different pieces of equipment are called, such as the \"side pipe\", which is used to roll a car onto it's side.",

The action takes places 15 years after a cataclysmic event that causes planet-wide earthquakes which destroy most of human civilization. What remains of humanity now lives in the depths of the oceans, where an evil military-industrial complex seeks total control.\n\nThe Alliance rises to defend humanity from this foe; the player is tasked with controlling the Chronos, the Alliance's newest sub, through various missions starting with the maiden voyage. While most of the game takes place underwater, there is also some sea-level fighting, including a number of boss fights.\n\nThe submarine controls are complex and it has the ability to rapidly ascend or descend, manoeuvres which are essential in combat. The Chronos uses a variety of weapons - cannons, torpedoes and special weapons - and equipment which can be upgraded throughout the game by completing missions and collecting artifacts.",

        "description": "As the conflict between the mighty nation of Harmonia and the tribal inhabitants of the Grasslands evolved, a man who possessed the True Fire Rune stepped in. Called the Flame Champion, he led the Grasslands against Harmonian invasion, and eventually unleashed the power of his rune in a decisive battle, causing the death of many people on both sides. Harmonia retreated, and the Flame Champion disappeared. An uneasy truce was achieved, but the relationship between the Grasslands and the neighbor merchant nation of Zexen grew steadily worse.\n\nChris Lightfellow, known as the \"Silver Maiden\", is the captain of the Zexen Knights, commanding its forces after a truce agreement between Zexen and the Grasslands has been broken. She is increasingly dissatisfied with the Zexen leadership, and is determined to find her missing father. Hugo is the son of Lucia, the chief of the Karaya clan of the Grasslands. When he finds his village in flames, he swears revenge against the nation of Zexen and its knights. Meanwhile, Harmonia's authorities send an enigmatic mercenary leader named Geddoe to investigate rumors concerning the return of the Flame Champion.\n\nThe events of Suikoden III take place sixteen years after those described in its predecessor. The game retains many distinguishing gameplay features from the series' previous installments, including equipment of magic runes with limited spell uses instead of the more common magic points system; the possibility to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny), many of which can participate in battles; customization of a castle serving as army headquarters, etc. Tactical army battle mechanics are similar to those employed in the second installment.\n\nThe game's most significant new feature is its so-called \"Trinity Sight System\". Instead of controlling a single main protagonist, the player takes the roles of Chris, Hugo, and Geddoe during the course of nine chapters (three per character). These chapters focus on the conflict between the Grasslands and Zexen, and represent three different points of view on the events. Afterwards the player must select the character he or she considers the principal protagonist of the game. The game also includes two optional chapters told from the point of view of another character.\n\nIn addition to leveling up and raising the effectiveness of their weapons and armor, characters can also learn skills - passive abilities that improve the their combat performance, such as parrying, dealing higher damage, acting quicker, etc. Magic spells typically take longer time to cast, which can be remedied by improving a correspondent skill. Some magic spells also have area effects, dealing damage to enemies and allies alike. The player controls six characters in battle, divided into three pairs: the leaders of the pairs are actively controlled, while their companions act according to AI routines.",

The game now allows you to turn yourself into a your guardian creature, which augments your abilities considerably. But using this morphed form too much has an effect on which ending you receive (as does which characters you select at the beginning of the game).",

The player controls a party of characters who join the protagonist as dictated by the plot. Combat flows in real time, with the player actively controlling only one character.

What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.\n\nSummoner 2 abandons the combo-based real-time combat of the predecessor and is more action-oriented, with the player directly controlling the physical attacks of the main character. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia\u2019s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia\u2019s skills improve. It is also possible to choose to adventure in \u201csolo-mode\u201d, leaving the party members behind to go on alone.",

Each mode has difficulty settings. In certain modes, choose the size of the waves and the weather effects.\n\nSpeed and direction is controlled with the analog stick and there are buttons for tricking, paddling, diving and cutbacks. Each surfer has more than 50 tricks that can be performed, the most elaborate ones scoring the highest points.\n\nLicensed music by well-known punk rock bands forms the basis of the soundtrack. In addition to the single-player game, Sunny Garcia Surfing has a multiplayer games offering play against a friend or eight of them using two multi-taps for the Playstation 2.",

It adds a new multiplayer mode and features graphical enhancements.\n\nThe aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.\n\nClassic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme. Two players can also compete against each other.",

Use the provided race or drift truck setups or create your own by adjusting your truck's tire pressure levels, suspension, steering locks and traction control. You are also able to practice on a track before you play to become familiar with your truck and the circuit. You can also qualify to try and get a front spot on the starting line.\n\nSix game modes are available to play. In Single Race Mode, quickly race against computer opponents with any unlocked vehicle and track. Championship Mode allows the competition of five championship races, each progressing in difficulty. Try to unlock all the extra trucks and circuits in this game mode. In Arcade Mode, you are to race against the clock and try to make each checkpoint to continue in the race. Time Trial Mode provides freedom to roam a track by yourself to try and make a record lap time. VS Mode is a split-screen competition involving two human players. Lastly, in Survival Mode, you will start out in last place and try to work your way to first place. After each lap, the truck in last place is disqualified.\n\nAfter it is all said and done, head over to the replay theater to playback your saved replays. Or take a gander in the trophy room to see all the trophies you have received. Then take a view at your records where you can view all of your great racing achievements.",

As at the beginning of the game your sword play starts with what seems like \"swinging a bat\" rather than a sword technique, you improve your skill and techniques by \"stealing\" techniques by dueling with other swordsmen of which you add to your own library of sword techniques and customize which techniques suit your purposes.\n\nThe \"semi-RPG\" elements refer to the \"skill and techniques\" development of your character. The more duels, missions and bouts your character accomplishes, the more sword techniques your character will eventually learn as well as gradually increasing your character stats.\n\nThus dueling is the essence of the gameplay, may it be a friendly match with wooden swords or unofficial death matches using your steel sword (katana).\n\nSwordplay techniques are extremely complicated at first, comprising of detailed forms: Stances, each with different types of attacks; Parrying and the ability to counter attack after a correct block; Stance Attack, the ability for a surprise attack against a correct stance and much more.\n\nLearn all these techniques by dueling, learning from the local dojo's and ultimately gaining enough fame and skill to duel the many wandering master swordsmen that may teach you a thing or two about special sword skills.",

Over the centuries, the factory has been developing clockwork devices, specializing in perpetual mechanical movement. The factory's ambitions, however, are ill-suited to the contemporary economic climate, and the elderly Anna Voralberg, at the helm of the Valadilene factory for more than half a century, has decided to sell up.\n\nIt turns out that the takeover might not be as straightforward as expected. The day that Kate Walker arrives, Anna Voralberg is being buried. What is more is that she has left an heir \u2013 her brother Hans. But Hans had left the valley at the end of the thirties and never returned, and was actually believed to be dead. However, a letter written by Anna in the days leading up to her death reveals that Hans is well and truly alive and living somewhere in Siberia. Valadilene's elderly notary entrusted to take care of Anna's affairs suggests that Kate find Hans Voralberg as he is now the only person in a position to ratify the sale of the family business.\n\nSyberia is a traditional puzzle-solving adventure. The player navigates a 3D model of the protagonist over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Puzzles are mostly inventory-based, though some involve manipulating the environment (such as mechanical devices). The interface features a single cursor; only highlighted objects can be interacted with, and there are no verb choice commands.",

However, the name of the hotel in Aralbad is written incorrectly.\n\nMarketing\n\nSome German games magazine editors received a postcard from New York with a handwritten text from someone called Kate who wrote in German, that she had an Austrian uncle, some problems and so on. There was no clue that this was a PR-event for the game Syberia, even the fake-handwriting was done with some smeared ink.\n\nPlayStation 2 version\n\nContrary to the Xbox release, the PS2 version did not appear in North America, as SCEA did not approve the game there.\n\nReferences\nThe rat from Road to India makes a cameo appearance in Syberia. It appears in the basement in Kolmkozgrad, makes exactly the same movements it did in Road to India, and disappears.\nSyberia contains some references to another game by Microids, Amerzone .

        "description": "Not to be confused with Tales of Destiny II (original name Tales of Eternia), this installment in the Tales Of... series, unreleased in the West, is one of the few \"true\" sequels within the franchise, directly connected in its setting and plot to Tales of Destiny.\n\nThe story takes place eighteen years after the events depicted in Tales of Destiny. Kyle, the son of the previous game's hero, is trying to find support for an orphanage operated by his parents. On his journey, he comes into contact with a powerful energy source known as Lens. A girl steps out of it, telling Kyle that she is on a quest to find a true hero. Naturally, Kyle is that hero; and very soon, he will have to prove it, when a mysterious woman uses the power of the Lens to revert history, sending Kyle into an alternate universe, in which the ancient Aeth'er Wars were won by a different side...\n\nGameplay-wise, Tales of Destiny 2 is very similar to its predecessors in the series. As before, most of the game is played in a Japanese RPG fashion, with town and dungeon exploration, and random combat. The trademark side-scrolling action-based battles of the series remain intact in this installment; for the first time, a zoom feature allows a more detailed view of combat.\n\nPlayer-controlled characters learn skills of different tiers, which can be chained into combos. Performing combos increases the damage inflicted on the enemy, and provides bonus experience. Powerful special techniques cost TP (technical points) as well as SP (spirit points) to execute.",

The game is set in a unique alternative medieval Japan, a world which is mostly based on the European's image of Japan, with deliberately exaggerated characteristics and clich\u00e9s. The graphics have been completely remade, although the 3D characters were made to look in the style of old 2D RPGs. There are also many anim\u00e9-style videos who have a distinctly comic look. The battles are fought from first person perspective, and have a fairly standard system of physical attacks and magic.",

Afterwards they tweaked a few thing to make him look more Terminator-like, e.g. a bigger chest. In their approval meeting they talked with Schwarzenegger and his manager. While the manager had problems with every detail they changed, Schwarzenegger was very relaxed about the looks. His only suggestion was to make the chest even wider."

There are three kinds of racing to master: Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble.\n\nCircuit Races are exactly as they sound. The player howls around a course through checkpoints before time runs out at least twice.\n\nBlitz Races are considerably shorter than Circuit Races. The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B.\n\nIn Scramble Races the player roars around an area \"collecting\" checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible. These are the shortest races in the game.\n\nThis game can be played by two players.",

Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true.\n\nThe Adventures of Cookie & Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time. There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels.\n\nIt is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.",

In the game the player needs to jump, shoot, and collect a variety of objects to create multiple inventions as you traverse level to level solving puzzles, defeating various villains, and even taking control of Jimmy's robot dog, Goddard, with upgrades like riding him as a bike or taking him to the skies.\n\nMajor and minor inventions exist to enable your progression through each of the game's five worlds; with the major inventions being crucial to defeating the boss in every world. The minor inventions help you to defeat the various enemies and obstacles you'll encounter throughout. All the minor inventions feature a primary and secondary action to further your options for weaponry or to traverse through the various areas Jimmy will need to go through to save his world from peril.\n\nThe plot sees Jimmy Neutron posed with an assignment to write a book report for school but, instead, he decides to invent a device by the name of the Virtual World Reproduction Machine, which is designed to show any book that you put into it like it's a movie.\n\nDuring his presentation, Jimmy places a Jet Fusion book into the machine to demonstrate the device to his class. However, this leads it to malfunction, turning the town of Retroville into a virtual world. Professor Calamitous, Jimmy's arch-enemy, kidnaps the top-secret government agency spy Jet Fusion, who's more known to the public as the popular actor from the Jet Fusion films. It's now up to Jimmy to save Jet and his world from being taken over by the evil Calamitous.",

The game starts with Timmy\u2019s parents leaving for a seminar weekend leaving the babysitter Vicky in charge. Timmy accidentally wishes he doesn\u2019t have to follow the rules from Cosmo and Wanda\u2019s fairy rulebook anymore. Cosmo grants this wish with the rulebook falling to the floor, but soon a news bulletin arrives that states that the first person touching the book will gain Cosmo and Wanda\u2019s powers. Moments later Vicky picks up the book spelling trouble for Timmy and the fairies. Cosmo, Wanda, and Timmy are then summoned to the Fairy court. They are found guilty for losing the rulebook and are sentenced to retrieve the rulebook within 49,5 hours or lose their Fairy license forever.\n\nIn the game, you take control of Timmy Turner and have to retrieve the pages from the rulebook through a variety of environments ranging from cyberspace to a medieval castle. Gameplay includes platforming, defeating enemies, and puzzle-solving. As well as collecting wish stars (5 stars for a wish) and crowns (100 crowns for another chance at a failed task). All levels are accessed from different objects in the house.",

        "description": "Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster who wants to forget his past and live honestly with his wife and little son. Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson, decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped.\n\nJolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries.\n\nOnce the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's, shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.\n\nThe Getaway is a hybrid of driving and third-person shooter gameplay, similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. London has been digitally recreated for this game, and the player can explore it freely on foot or driving a vehicle. Unlike GTA III, missions follow each other linearly, dictated by the plot. The game is more story-driven and does not have any free-roaming activities. Many of the driving sequences also have a time limit, restricting free exploration.\n\nEach mission usually consists of a driving section, which requires the player to drive to a certain destination (sometimes chasing another vehicle or being chased by enemies), and a third-person shooter section, often with an additional driving section afterwards. Police or rival gangs will frequently pursue the protagonist. The player can hijack any car or bus from the streets, or move on foot.\n\nThird-person shooter sequences are longer and more prominently featured than the corresponding sections of GTA III. The protagonist can perform a variety of moves: sneak, crouch, roll to the sides, etc. A few missions are completely stealth-oriented, and are failed if the player character is discovered by enemies. It is possible to use the butt of the gun as a melee weapon, and also take hostages to prevent the police from shooting at the player character.\n\nThe game's distinguishing visual feature is a total absence of visible interface and text feedback. Rather than consulting a map, the player follows the car's blinking lights to arrive at the right destination. Damage taken by the protagonist is indicated by the character bending over, walking slower, and having blood on his clothes. Health is recovered by resting (leaning against a wall); there are no health kits scattered around. The protagonist can carry only two small or one larger weapon at once.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nDevelopment\n\nThe game took almost three years to make. The development team recreated 40 square kilometers (about 25 square miles) of central London, in which the game is based. Over 500,000 images were taken by the developers of the London streets and locations featured in the game.\n\nInterface\n\nThe game did not feature any on-screen indicators as to how much health, ammo, or time you had left:\n\nWhen you got shot/hurt in the game, your character would bleed through their clothing and limp, holding their chests. The amount of blood on your clothes and speed you moved at indicated how much damage you'd sustained. When you rested against a wall (there are no health kits in the game), you regained your health.\n\nYour character could use 2 pistols or 1 machine gun/shotgun at a time. When the machine gun/shotgun emptied out, your character would drop the empty gun and pull out their pistol(s). When you ran low on pistol ammo, your character would drop one pistol, indicating that you were running low on ammo and that you need to find ammo fast!\n\nOn timed driving missions, the in-game music would indicate how much time you had left to finish your mission. The music got more and more urgent as the mission progressed until you either finished the level or passed the time limit and it was time to try again.\n\nAn interesting little touch in the driving missions, instead of an arrow on screen telling you which way to go, as with Crazy Taxi, before you came up to an intersection, the indicators on the car would flash telling you whether you needed to go left or right. If no indicators were flashing, you were headed in the right direction. If you were headed in the opposite direction, one would flash until you turned 180 degrees. When you got to where you were supposed to be going, both would flash (your hazard lights) to indicate you should stop, exit the car and explore.\n\nRatings\n\nThe Getaway was initially rated as MA15+ (restricted for ages below 15) by the OFLC (Australian rating organization) for medium violence level. Five weeks later, the OFLC revised their initial rating. While still being classified as MA15+, it was now for high violence level. But that\u2019s not all. Only 5 days after the revision, on November 27, 2002, the game was revised a second time. Now the rating classification changed, from MA15+ to RC (Refused Classification). That means: from this day on, it is illegal to exhibit, rent or sell this game in Australia. This includes adults, because the Computer Game part of the OFLC is lacking a true Adult-Only category, such a category is only in the two other parts (Film and Publications) available.\n\nSales\n\nOn August 31, 2003 has The Getaway (PS2) won the Gold-Award from the German VUD (Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland - Entertainment Software Association Germany) for selling more then 100,000 (but less then 200,000) units in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nInformation also contributed by Xoleras\n\n More"

        "description": "The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters '99. This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.\n\nThe King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the \"alternate\" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden \"maniac\" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.",

However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant's way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS.\n\nThe character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.",

        "description": "Following the events of Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, his goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Following the defeat of Kain's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order, which is very oppressive towards its citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears revenge on the one who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as the ruler of the vampires.\n\nThe Legacy of Kain Series: Blood Omen 2 is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player views the environment from behind Kain's shoulder, moving him in different directions, attacking, jumping, using dark gifts, and grabbing on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.\n\nThe Serafan Order uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progressing because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down its path, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.",

        "trivia": "Trivia\nDevelopment\n\nMany of the art and characters, and the main storyline has been recycled from an unfinished Dreamcast sequel of Chakan, a Sega Genesis title. The main reason for the similarity is that both the cancelled Chakan game and Blood Omen 2 share their lead artist, Steve Ross. He also co-wrote the Blood Omen 2 story. In addition to the general similarity of themes, Chakan himself differs from the Blood Omen 2-era Kain only in that his body and face are harder-worn and he wears a hat, a worm-riding character is clearly the predecessor to Umah, several enemies bear the \"broken ankh\" symbol of the Sarafan in Blood Omen 2, enemy designs range from very similar to virtually identical, and the depiction of the streets of the city is essentially a futuristic version of Meridian.\n\nHere's part of the planned storyline:\n\nThe City has existed since the beginning of time. Once it was a place of transcendent beauty and purity governed by five beings known as the Aeris. Then, many centuries ago, a catastrophic plague ripped through The City. This scourge cleaved each Aeris into two separate entities: A Siren, a being of light and song, and a Daemon, a dark, vile creature.\n\nThe Daemons soon overwhelmed the Sirens beginning a long reign of brutality and horror. They stripped away the Sirens' souls turning them into pitiful empty creatures who wander aimlessly through The City. The Daemons imprisoned the Siren souls in Soul Worlds; strange domains existing beyond space and time.\n\nWith no one left to challenge their power the Daemons began to feed on The City's population. They did not feed on the flesh of their victims, but on their souls, their life force. Through centuries of dark rule The City was transformed from a place of peace and serenity into a cruel, hard, twisted place. A place of horror, death and decay.\n\nThe striking similarities between these projects and Blood Omen 2 led many Kain fans to believe that Blood Omen 2 was some sort of re-branded Chakan. Some concept artwork was available http://www.andnow.net/chakan/artwork.html\n\nThere are also some connections to a cancelled game called Siren. More information on the topic is available on the fansite The Lost Worlds.\n\nHylden\n\nThe Hylden are those yellow creatures that were depicted fighting the blue winged vampires in the ancient murals that Raziel kept finding all the time in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2.\n\nSoul Reaver\n\nDespite the depiction of Kain holding the sword known as Soul Reaver on both the game's cover art and it's title screen, in fact Kain is lacking the Soul Reaver, having it taken from him before the game even begins.\n\nVoice Acting\n\nA sample of Kain's famous \"Vae Victus!\" battlecry (used extensively in Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain) was recorded for the name but not used.\n\nVorador\n\nThere has been quite a lot of discussion about whether the appearance of Vorador in Blood Omen 2 has a real explanation or it's just a pulled-out-of-the-nose item, like to give the voice actor something to do. Near the ending, Kain and Vorador engage in a discussion from which it raises a challenge for a future confrontation between them. In this discussion, Kain already says something about Vorador being 'reborn a second time'. This not only begins to explain that there is an explanation behind Vorador's presence in this game, but also might hint the possibility of more installments of the series.\n\nInformation also contributed by b\u00e4cht\u00ebrm\u00e4n, Mark Ennis and WildKard\n\n More"

        "description": "Chandar is a floating world populated by different races; unfortunately, not all of them are at peace with each other. One day, a young warrior of the Orin race named Jarik, who lived in the small town Hollow Grange, awoke from a terrible nightmare. He saw a mysterious evil creature consuming the energy of the planet. At the same moment, a group of warriors of the Dagani race attacked the town. One of them turned into a horrifying monster when Jarik killed him. A strange stone was coughed out by the creature, and after Jarik touched it, a scar was burned into his hands...\n\nThe Legend of Alon d'Ar is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. The player controls Jarik and a party of characters as they roam the world, completing quests, acquiring items, and fighting enemies. Battles either occur at pre-set points, or are triggered randomly. Combat is a mixture of turn-based and real-time styles, somewhat similar to the ATB system of Final Fantasy games. The difference is that in this game, the amount of time a character has to wait before acting is directly related to the weapon and/or magic spell he/she is using.\n\nThe game features heavy customization of weapons and spells. To upgrade them, the player needs to distribute PP (proficiency points) collected in battles. Weapons and spells have different characteristics, which can be enhanced individually by channeling PP into them. For example, it is possible to upgrade the attack speed of daggers by investing proficiency points into the corresponding categories.",

Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.\n\nPlayers, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth.\n\nThe player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.\n\nSeveral levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.\n\nMost combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm's Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film.\n\nBetween the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine.\n\nThe game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.",

The mission's scenes are not played in succession, but are tucked between the usual missions. They also feature 2 exclusive gadgets.\n\nIn place of the music score created by Guy Whitmore for the original release, the PlayStation 2 version has a soundtrack written by Rebecca Kneubuhl and mixed by Gabriel Mann.

However, months before release, the developers realised that retail PlayStation 2 consoles had much slower disc drives than the development units they had been sent, and that they wouldn't be capable of sufficiently loading the game map. In order to keep the game the same across all 3 platforms, all versions had the map split into levels, and paths that would have led to a part of a different level were blocked off with unexplained piles of scrap metal.\n\nCharacter Select screen\n\nThe game's character select will play a short \"preview\" for each character when they are being highlighted. These preview consist of a short animation and a line of dialogue. The final version of the game uses the same animations as the beta, but almost all of the dialogue was changed for no known reason.\n\nRemoved Passenger\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version features a passenger in the Evergreen Terrace level located in an alleyway outside Smithers' apartment. This passenger will always ask to visit Smithers' apartment, allowing players to exploit the passenger and earn unrealistically high scores. The Xbox and GameCube versions removed this passenger, likely due to balancing issues.\n\nGame Ending\n\nAll three versions of the game end with a cutscene of Mr Burns admitting defeat and warning the player that they \"haven't seen the last of Monty Burns\". On the PlayStation 2 version of the game, this is immediately followed with the credits. The Xbox and GameCube versions of the game have an additional cutscene before the credits where it is revealed that the game was actually being played by aliens Kang and Kodos, who exclaim that it has become tiresome and proceed to \"insert the ultimate game disc\", a copy of Pong.\n\nGame Builds\n\nBased on the game ending and removed passenger, the PlayStation 2 version of the game seems to be running on an earlier build of the game as opposed to the Xbox and GameCube versions.\n\n More"

In a corrupt city this was bad news and it cost Harry his job but, worse than that, it cost him his girlfriend as Claire Anderson was killed by the mafia.\nHarry left town and trained under an ex-army veteran to become a top sniper. He returned home to take his revenge and found an ally in the mysterious C.A. who supplied him with inside information. When the last mafia boss was dead Harry finally met C.A and found she was Melissa, the little girl he rescued all those years ago, she'd grown a bit but she was still a kid who for some reason possessed the memories of his beloved Claire.\n\nThe game starts with Harry and C.A. On the run and driving through the desert in a big pink Cadillac. They pick up Stanley who's car has broken down, in return for the favour Stanley takes them to his favourite diner in Sacramento where he treats them to a meal. While they are eating more mafia show up and start shooting, using a rifle supplied by the diner's lady owner Harry fights back and the game truly begins.\n\nThis game differs from most action games, it's called 'Sniper' and that's what the game delivers, short sections of action where the kill shot must be made within one to two minutes separated by sections of storytelling. Every shot is graded and every shot must be a kill-shot, miss or just wound the target and it's game over, though the player is given the chance to try again.\nOnce the mafia hit men are dealt with the story unfolds into something involving the C.I.A., a shipment of nerve toxin, and secret meetings.\n\nThe game has a training mode which introduces the player to the controls, however this is limited to stages the player has unlocked.",

It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear.\n\nThe game's story is built around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.\n\nUnlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.",

The file: \"creditsspeech.ogg\", is an easter egg featuring Presidents Bush II, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, game characters, and others congratulating Blake on a job well done.\n\nCameo\n\nJohn Carpenter himself makes a cameo appearance as Dr. Faraday, the head of Gen Inc you meet halfway through the game. Apparently Carpenter went down to the programmer's studios and had his face scanned into the game. This explains why Carpenter says the game has \"an incredibly cool and handsome character in Dr. Faraday\" in his praise of the game on the inside cover of the box.\n\nGerman version\n\nThere are various changes in the German version: * Almost all blood effects removed * The mutation animation was shortened * Headless corpses used as level decoration were replaced with regular corpses and cut off limbs removed altogether * Team members don't perform suicide * Death animations of humans were removed * Removed death cries * In two cutscenes violent scenes were removed\n\nA detailed list of changes can be found on schnittberichte.com (German).\n\nInspiration\n\nThe Thing is based on the 1982 cult movie The Thing by John Carpenter. That movie is actually a remake of 1951's The Thing From Another World by Howard Hawks and that movie in turn is based on the 1943 short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell.\n\nTransformation\n\nWhen your NPC teammates turn into the Thing, they generally turn into the same monster... one with a head that looks a little like a skinless lizard. However, there is one character called Fisk who, if infected, transforms into a slightly different looking Thing with a distorted, stretched-out human face.\n\nSince Fisk is a Gen Inc trooper, and since the troopers were originally supposed to be infected humans who would burst out to attack you, it's possible this is a leftover from the original game design, especially since the Fisk-Thing seems kind of buggy as it's head tends to disappear when you look at it from different angles.\n\nReferences\nNear the beginning of the game, you'll find the sign seen at the first part of the movie noting where you are.\nA few moments later you will get into some pit, where you will find the remains of MacReady's shack. Inside the shack, you will find the recorder with MacReady's message. It is not the original recording done in the movie. Rather, it was done by a soundalike, and was timed differently.\nIn the room where you encounter the character named Carter, you will find the infamous Norwegian who cut his own throat to avoid being taken over.\nThe first set of CCTV camera controls you get to mess with will switch you to a view of the room behind a door needing an access code. Fans of the movie will instantly recognize this room: Look around and you'll find the ice block the Thing was originally thawed from!\nTrailer\n\nIf you let the game's menu screen sit for a minute or two, the game's trailer starts. The trailer is also available if you explore the installed FMV folder.\n\nInformation also contributed by Alan Chan, CaptainCanuck, Dr. M. \"Schadenfreude\" Von Katze and Terrence Bosky.\n\n More"

        "description": "Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in this edition of the series. The biggest addition to this version is EA's Game Face, which lets you customize the players' physical appearance. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and \"pissed off\" animations for when you score a triple bogey.\n\nOne of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent's clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice.\n\nA new feature is the game's ability to read your console's internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If it's near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event.\n\nAll top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly.\n\nMost of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy. One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington.\n\nLike all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles. The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004. This feature isn't on the PC version.\n\nGamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA's matchmaking service. You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions.\n\nIf you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.",

Or will we be condemned forever to a realm ruled under the shadow of the TimeSplitters. In the 1-player game you travel from time to time to collect different artifacts before the Timesplitters can. The multiplayer game is 4-player Deathmatch with the option of adding several bots.",

        "description": "TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design's PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between.\n\nThe game's story finds Cortez, the series' hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.\n\nDepending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.\n\nLike its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).\n\nThe Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI \"bots\" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.",

This time, the school in question is Moegino High, and the suggested \"main\" love interest is called Yukiko Makihara.\n\nTokimeki Memorial 3 differs from its predecessors in graphical style: it is the first in the series that utilizes character animation and 3D cel-shaded graphics.\n\nThe gameplay in Tokimeki Memorial 3 underwent certain changes compared to the previous games. One of the main changes is a simplification of the complex statistics system. The hero has only three main parameters in this game: strength, willpower, and stress. Progress with a girl is measured by levels, similarly to role-playing games. Otherwise, the game still retains the simulation approach, and includes the traditional schedule-making, date-choosing, and participating in various school and leisure activities. The protagonist can also wear different clothes, have different hobbies, and even dedicate his time to playing video games.",

Very soon she discovers that there are many attractive boys studying at the school. The goal thus becomes to find a good, caring boyfriend - and the choice is entirely up to the player.\n\nLike the other Tokimeki Memorial games, the gameplay revolves mostly around setting up schedules, and raising the heroine's parameters, which includes general characteristics such as health or beauty, as well as more detailed ones, such as proficiency in literature, arts, etc. The heroine can also take part-time jobs, go shopping, participate in school activities, cultivate hobbies, and so on - all of which might have an influence on the potential male love interest.",

        "description": "In Tokyo Bus Guide, players drive on three real-world routes of the Toei Bus service. In addition to stopping at the right bus stops on time, triggering announcements, and ensuring passenger comfort by not accelerating or braking too harshly, drivers also have to follow the rules of traffic by stopping at traffic lights, obeying speed limits, and correctly indicating when turning or changing lanes. Part of a green \"life bar\" in the lower left corner of the screen turns red every time a rule is violated or a task not completed correctly. More serious violations, such as crashing into another vehicle, entail more serious consequences than minor mishaps, such as forgetting to announce the next stop. The life bar can be replenished by passing or stopping at stations on time. When the life bar turns entirely red, the player is forced to retire prematurely.\n\nThe three routes selectable in the game are the Niji 01 (across the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo Bay area), Tian 70 (in the busy Shinjuku ward; this line was decommissioned in 2000), and Ume 76 (a more rural route in Western Tokyo). All the routes can be driven at noon, in the evening, or at night, with respectively different traffic density and amount of passengers. Some of the routes and schedules have to be unlocked by gaining experience in Story mode. Story mode also includes short cutscenes of interactions and monologues of some of the passengers, which play at certain bus stops. These cutscenes unlock brief files on the respective passenger's profiles in the main menu, along with occasional entries into an album. There is also a Free Run mode where no data is saved and no content can be unlocked.\n\nA mini-game that can be downloaded to the Visual Memory unit is a quiz game on Japanese road signs.",

        "description": "Tokyo Xtreme Racer is a one or two player racing game based on illegal street racing around the streets of Tokyo.\n\nThe game starts by giving the player $15000 so that they can buy their car. There are three types of car; Class A has the most powerful engines; Class B has mid range engines but are better balanced; and Class C cars lack power but have better handling. Needless to say the cash the payer starts with is sufficient for the lower cars in each group, players need to win cash if they are to upgrade.\n\nAfter the car has been selected the player enters their name and customises their number plate that's when the game really begins. There are seven 'game modes' of which five are different ways to play the game, these game modes are the same for all classes of car.* Mode 1: This is the Quest mode where the player tries to rise to the top by looking for other racers to challenge\n\nCars can be tuned, changed, and upgraded prior to each race. After each race the player can replay their race, save it to replay later, or just save the result.",

        "description": "Splinter Cell is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth, similar to the Metal Gear Solid series. The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of. His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.\n\nTo get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.\n\nOther features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a \"snake\" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.\n\nThe Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube. The latter have slight changes in levels generally to make it a little easier. Each version also contains some exclusive features. The Xbox and PC versions include three additional downloadable missions (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack). The PS2 version has an exclusive level, and the GameCube version can be connected with a Game Boy Advance through a link cable to view an overhead map. The PS2 and GameCube versions include additional binocular items, and the latter also has an extra sticky bomb weapon. The PS2 release also has an exclusive 5min pre-rendered intro cinematic with full orchestrated score, showing how the two agents you are sent to look for at the beginning of the game were captured.",

It can be played whether the game was beaten or not.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe PS2 version was ported over by Ubisoft Shanghai in China. It was developed within 4 months.\n\nFifth Freedom\n\nOne possible source of the Fifth Freedom concept is Noam Chomsky's preface to The Culture of Terrorism: \"U.S. international and security policy ... has as its primary goal the preservation of what we might call \u201cthe Fifth Freedom,\u201d understood crudely but with a fair degree of accuracy as the freedom to rob, to exploit and to dominate, to undertake any course of action to ensure that existing privilege is protected and advanced.\" FDR's original Four Freedoms are Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear.\n\nHacking\n\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell is one of the three Xbox games that, with the help of Action Replay, can hack into an unmodified Xbox. The other two being 007: Agent Under Fire and MechAssault.\n\nNovels\n\nPenguin has published novels inspired by the game; Sam Fisher's adventures continue in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (2004), Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda (2005) and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Checkmate (2006), all (perhaps confusingly) written by Raymond Benson under the pseudonym \"David Michaels\".\n\nReferences\nThe vehicle that picks up Sam outside the police station at the end of the first level is a delivery van from St-Hubert, a popular restaurant in Montreal where the game was designed. Just look at its logo and compare it to the one on www.st-hubert.com.\nOn the level Chinese Embassy, Part II (the second time playing in the Chinese Embassy), go down the back alley (not through the front door of the restaurant) and use the optic cable on the door. The chef can be heard humming If I Were a Rich Man from the movie (or play) Fiddler on the Roof.\nIn the original Chinese Embassy level, Sam is told to meet with a mission contact. Once he comes into contact with him, he is to introduce with the code phrase \"A bright cold day in April\", which is the first line of the novel 1984, written by George Orwell.\nThird Echelon\n\nIn the game, Sam Fisher works for Third Echelon. The real world ECHELON is a global intelligence initiative run by the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While ECHELON's full capabilities (and intentions) are unknown, the ACLU reports estimates that the network intercepts up to 3 billion messages (phone, e-mail, Internet) daily.\n\nVersion Differences\n\nThe PC version of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is fairly closely based on the original Xbox version. Both were made by Ubisoft Montreal. The GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions, which were developed by Ubisoft Shanghai, are similar to each other, but have many small changes over the originals with the result that they are generally easier. Some doors are moved around, guards are less likely to notice gunshots, etc.\n\nEach version of the game, except for Windows, has some exclusive features. The Xbox release has two new missions downloadable via Xbox Live which involve a Russian nuclear sub. The PlayStation 2 version includes an exclusive level which takes place in a nuclear power plant, new cinematics, a new intro cinematic with original music by the Prague Orchestra, and many behind-the-scenes interviews and documentaries both about the new intro and the game itself. GameCube uses the Game Boy Advance link cable to give you a real-time overhead map and a new sticky-bomb weapon. Additionally, both GCN and PS2 include a new binoculars items.\n\nAwards\n4Players\n2002\u2013 Best Xbox Game of the Year\n2002 \u2013 Best Xbox Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\n2002 \u2013 Best Xbox Action Game of the Year (Readers' Vote)\n2003 \u2013 Best PC Action Game of the Year\nComputer Gaming World\nFebruary 2006 (Issue #259) \u2013 Introduced into the Hall of Fame\nGameSpy\n2002 \u2013 Xbox Game of the Year\n2002 \u2013 Xbox Game of the Year (Readers' Choice)\n\nGolden Joystick Awards\n\n2003 - Runner-up to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for Xbox Game of the Year.\n\nVerband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (Entertainment Software Association Germany)\n\nAugust 31, 2003 - Gold-Award for selling more then 100,000 (but less then 200,000) units in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

        "description": "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is the fourth game in Activision's skateboarding franchise.\n\nThe main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.\n\nAll the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.\n\nThe levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.\n\nFor multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.",

        "description": "The fifth game in the series, Tony Hawk's Underground is the first game to have a true career mode.\n\nYou begin the game as a local skater whom nobody knows. Your board is wearing thin, and your tired of being a nobody. As your out skating, you see a flyer for a pro who's coming to your city to demo. You go to the skate demo and watch. Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star. With your friend, Eric, you're now on your way to becoming a legend.\n\nTHUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals. You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple. Eventually, you'll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii. Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals.\n\nTHUG introduces a new system; walking. You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level. If there's a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down. One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080's and up.\n\nAlso new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener's truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower. These are used for goals, but can be unlocked to drive whenever and wherever.\n\nNext to the standard Create-a-Park and Create-a-Skater, you can now create your own decks and your own tricks. The biggest feature is Create-a-Goal. You can create custom goals for one of the levels (or your own), and choose what pedestrian will give it to you, his/her dialogue, and what they'll say when you win.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version supports online play.",

        "description": "Totaled! is an action racing game, similar to the Destruction Derby games. Dispensing with any pretence of simulation, the game aims for arcade gameplay. The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously.\n\nAlthough cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match. Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.\n\nMultiplayer comes with different game modes. Traditional Last Man Standing is supplemented with multiple variations. A Hunter game-type, where one car is designated a target and points can only be scored by hitting it. There is also a score target which encourages going for the big points hits and stunts, rather than destroying competitors. Others are defensive and offensive driving challenges and a game type where only points scored by performing jumps and stunts are counted. Multiplayer is supported through 4-player split-screen, but no through Xbox Live play or the system link.",

        "description": "Nick Kang is a young Chinese-American detective who has been suspended from the Los Angeles Police Department due to his extreme methods of policing and his ability to cause massive amounts of damage to property. However, Wanda Parks, the Chief of the E.O.D (Elite Operations Division), requires Nick's assistance in a case that involves attacks on various venues in the Chinatown district. At first Nick is reluctant to help, preferring the vigilante life and focusing on avenging his father's death. However, he eventually agrees to conduct the investigation, on one condition: he must do it his way.\n\nTrue Crime: Streets of LA is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.\n\nNick can hijack any car on the street (usually with little to no repercussions) and freely drive through the 240 square miles of Los Angeles. Nick is capable of firing his weapon when driving; in an open top vehicle, it is possible to aim anywhere. The player can also opt for exploring the city on foot. Nick will be frequently contacted by other police officers and informed about various street crimes. He can then fight perpetrators, arrest them, knock them unconscious, or kill them to deal with these crimes.\n\nThe gameplay during the missions is separated into third-person shooting, fighting, and (more rarely) stealth sequences. All of these usually take place in relatively small, restricted environments. The shooting sequences involve Nick dealing with waves of enemies that appear in different places. Nick must react quickly, moving, crouching, or diving (with a \"bullet time\" effect) to avoid enemy attacks. A limited amount of painkillers can be found in such stages.\n\nDuring the fighting sequences, Nick utilizes his martial arts techniques to defeat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. Nick can punch, kick, grapple and throw enemies. The player can execute combos by pressing various combinations of buttons consecutively. It is also possible to pick up primitive melee weapons lying around, or take them from enemies. Both shooting and fighting stages have destructible environments.\n\nStealth missions typically involve Nick traversing a hostile area without attracting the enemies' attention; the mission is failed if an enemy hasn't been dealt with silently, or shortly after he has discovered Nick. The player has the option of killing enemies or knocking them down; the latter awards the protagonist \"good cop\" points. Conversely, \"bad cop\" points are given to Nick for killing innocents or surrendered criminals. Depending on Nick's rating in these categories, the storyline branches during later chapters, leading to different endings.",

Last Man Standing is similar to Deathmatch but players do not respawn immediately, you have to wait until someone wins. In Collector, players have to collect items called 'artifacts'.

On returning to the Brun one day the player is met by their friend Mana who informs them that the town is deserted because they have been invaded. The whole country has been invaded by the kingdom of Jejune and board games are banned!\n\nMana takes the player to resistance HQ and explains that, because the player is so good they must tour round all the towns on the world map, play games in each location improve morale and weaken the invaders grip. More money can be earned by gambling or by taking part in the Sunday matches at the coliseum.\n\nTime in Brun is measured in weeks. Every Monday supporters of the resistance will pay in their money, on the same day the Jejune invaders will increase their hold in all regions by five percent. Money earned can be used to lobby citizens in a region to support the resistance, this is the game mechanic that allows players who are bad at one of the featured games, say Chess, to take control of that region without having to win at that game.\n\nThe games in the package are:* Kalah: an ancient African game, there's a good description of Kalah here\n\nCapture the Flag: is, according to the game's description, a Kogun variant of Sh\u014dgi, Sh\u014dgi as we all know is a Japanese board game closely related to Western chess and Chinese xiangqi.\n\nFan Tan: (aka Seven's, Parliament or Domino) is a card game in which the seven of each suit is laid on the table and the players take turns to play cards in sequence down to the ace and up to the king.\n\nChinese Checkers: is a game like these.\n\nChess: the champion of both strategy and board games, one of those games that need not be described here.\n\nBackgammon: considered by some to be a game with the perfect balance of skill and luck Backgammon, of which there are many implementations is another board game that needs no description.\n\nFour-In-A-Row: is a game of Connect Four.\n\nPage One: (aka American Page One or Pagat) is a card game in which each player starts with six cards and attempts to play them all onto a central stack. Cards can be disposed of if they match by number or suit.\n\nPonnuki Go: a simplified version of Go that focuses on the number of pieces captured.\n\nPairs: is a Concentration type of game played with Mah Jong tiles instead of cards\n\nThe menu carousel has a section which describes the rules for each game, another which describes the tactics to be employed, one each for the story mode and freeplay, and finally a section for game configuration options",

        "description": "\"Unlimited SaGa\" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.\n\n\"Unlimited SaGa\" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.",

        "description": "Unreal Tournament is completely different from Unreal: it is now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.\n\nAt the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.\n\nThe fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.\n\nAll these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.",

Players can race in cities such as Los Angeles, New York or Washington DC or can take part in a race through the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. Next to Time Trial and Single Race, the Tournament is the main event. It has been split up in three sections: Park Trial, City Trial and US Race. After completing a section, the next one is opened up.\n\nThe tracks contain obstacles and jumps. Enemies will try to push other cars off the road, and the police also make an appearance. Scattered around the tracks are power-ups that repair the car, provide boost or cash. The money can be used to upgrade the car, repair it or buy boost prior to the race. After completing an entire tournament with a certain car, an alternate vehicle becomes available for that character.\n\nIn the Windows version two-player duels are available over LAN or TCP/IP.

She explains to you that a prophecy foretold the Apocalypse, a total destruction of human civilization in 1099. You must build an army of fourteen best soldiers and try to prevent the Apocalypse.\n\nThe game advances through the hundred years between your rebirth and the prophesied Apocalypse. The strategic turn-based battles take place on a grid four squares wide and three rows deep. Seven of your fourteen warriors can actively participate in battle. You put the soldiers on the field in three rows: the first one attacks, the second one either supports the attackers or attacks with bows, the third one heals. Your HP is replenished after each battle, but soldiers carry over fatigue and excessive damage until their stats are lowered and you must bring them back to the town to rest. Since the soldiers you recruit age and eventually become unable to participate in battles (the immortal hero always remains the same), you must arrange the fights in such a way that a male and a female soldier will fall in love. If you have successfully developed a love story between two soldiers, they will bring children to the world, which will typically become stronger than their parents.",

With ferocity and ruthless efficiency, they descended upon the townfolk, enslaving them to work deep in the caves that surrounded their village.\n\nDark Yabu murdered the grandfather of the young Vexx, who managed to slip quietly aboard the enemy's windship. There, locked deep within Yabu's sanctum, was the last pair of Astani Battle-gauntlets. The gauntlets leapt onto Vexx's outstretched hands and bonded to his arms giving him special powers. Prepared to meet his destiny, Vexx embarks on a quest through volcanic islands, frozen citadels and giant castles to confront Dark Yabu, save his people and avenge the death of his grandfather.",

There are multiple paths on some levels so there is some incentive to replay the levels.\n\nThere is a 2 player co-operative mode which can still be played with two light guns or you can use the Dual Shock pad.

Each of them will roll with 'auto change' option, which you can set to 'manual change' at any time, and take control of the corresponding cameras and visual effects. Depending upon the song and the setting, you'll be able to change the view position of the camera, zoom in and out, rotate it by 360\u00b0, and slide from one side to another. Holding either of L1, L2, R1, or R2 button while switching cameras will create an extra morphing effect. In addition to that, you can create various visual effects with your analog stick by moving it to one of the four major sides. These effects also vary on scene and song, and vary from various picture distortions, lightning and fire effects, falling leaves, stars, flying butterflies, to golden dust traces Ayumi can leave as she moves while singing.\n\nThe second part is \"Ayu-Mix Studio\" which contains two tracks: Unite!, and Endless Sorrow, respectively. There you can play with audible part of the songs, and can follow the rhythm of drums, bass, synth, and switch it as you like. You can try to re-mix the song fully by yourself and create the new mode, or can select one of the three preset version each song has.\n\nIn addition to that, there is also \"Ayu Browser\" with its own design and options included, but doesn't make much use if you don't have internet access.",

Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.\n\nMultiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.",

Characters can obtain as many as 60 different swords and, with the proper equipment and practice, perform more than 100 different special moves. Also as in the original, the hero must choose his own path through the plot lines, and the decisions he makes can drastically affect the outcome of the story.\n\nThe adventure begins as the player's lone samurai warrior comes upon a small, remote village mired in the midst of large, internal dispute. The traditional village leaders favor fealty to feudalistic powers that are becoming prominent throughout the land, while a group of outlaw rebels, known as the Aoto, vehemently oppose acquiescence to the regional authority. As the main character and hero of the story, the player must bring resolution to this conflict, and peace to the town, in whatever Way he deems best.\n\nThere is a realistic day and night cycle and various strategical elements. You can talk to various characters, accept tasks and shop for new items. Decisions influence the relationships with the different groups. There are 60 swords, hammers and clubs to choose from, and you have to keep a variable quality and durability level in mind. You can perform both offensive and defensive moves, and even perform special actions. Swords can be enhanced or upgraded in stores, according to your fighting style.",

The game engine simulates the real physics of a sled on all kinds of surfaces such as snow, ice, mud and many others so the player has to pay attention to where and how to accelerate, break and turn in order to win a race. The AI engine uses a complicated model that simulates real human behaviors so that NPC opponents can fall asleep on fanfares or get reckless in a rage. Making different stunts is not the last tactic that might lead to the win.",

        "description": "In ancient times, a war was fought against demons on a world named Filgaia. The planet bears the scars of this encounter as much of the world is barren and the ocean has turned to sand. For different reasons, four characters set out to become \"drifters\" and make their own path over the plains. Virginia Maxwell chose this trip on a steam train because she was bored by the monotonous life in a sleepy village and wanted to explore the world. Treasure-hunter Jet Enduro thinks the train will bring him to a place where a flower with magic powers can be found. Gallows Caradine is a shaman of his tribe and is the guardian of a sacred artifact. Clive Winslet is a cynical archaeologist and part-time bounty hunter. A fateful encounter aboard a train will bring these four together and mix them up in the doings of a mysterious organization of scientists. This Council of Seven once was formed to renew the life force of Filgaia, but now seems to be harnessing it for their own means.\n\nThis third installment of the Wild Arms series continues the tradition of two previous games, adding a stronger emphasis on the (fantasy) Wild West atmosphere. Characters have the ability to attack using ARMS (projectile weapons), use special abilities, use items or cast Arcana (magic). From the beginning of the game, each of the four characters has an introductory chapter before becoming a party and traveling together. The battles are random, with a FP gauge which fills while attacking and defending, and usage of Arms and magic which require FP, similar to the second game of the series. Later on, special vehicles feature their own type of battle system. Other similarities to the previous game include the search system (towns and dungeons are not indicated on the map until you discover them), the ability to cancel a random battle and special abilities used outside of battles to solve puzzles. A new feature is a dialogue based on key words, similar to a system commonly used in adventure games, which allows a more flexible use of dialogue options.",

He is expelled from his home for using this power to defeat a monster. Jack is a careless treasure hunter who roams caves and ruins with his trusty friend, the blue rodent Hanpan. Cecilia is a young princess who was sent to a magician school to study the lore of magic. She has the ability to communicate with ancient powerful beings called the Guardians. The three heroes meet each other and embark on a journey to save the world of Filgaia from a grave danger.\n\n\"Wild Arms Alter Code: F\" is a remake of the original Wild Arms for Playstation. The basic gameplay premise remained the same: you participate in random turn-based battles, using attacks, special magic unique to each character, and other abilities (such as summoning Guardians). In dungeons there are many physical and environmental puzzles to solve. The remake features fully 3D graphics, changes and more detail in the design of many locations, and a new party to control. In the original, only Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia were available as playable characters. In the remake, several other characters can be taken into your party and even switched during the same battle.",

        "description": "Originally released for PC (Windows) under the same title, as an adult visual novel, the game was then ported to consoles with removed adult contents, but additional CG events and story elements to compensate for the lack of erotic scenes. The game follows Makoto Okano (\u4e18\u91ce \u771f) as he returns to his hometown after 10 years away. Before he left, he and Minamo Narukaze (\u9cf4\u98a8 \u307f\u306a\u3082) made a promise to each other to meet again. She told him she will keep on playing the harmonic and even though he may be too far away to see it, the wind will carry the melody, hopefully all the way to his place.\n\nTen long years have passed, and together with his younger sister, Hinata Okano (\u4e18\u91ce \u3072\u306a\u305f), Makoto returns to his hometown. One evening, after school classes, he hears a melody that attracts his attention, which in turn leads him to the roof where he sees a girl with a purple hair, playing a harmonica. Not realizing at first who she is, the truth soon becomes clear that the girl is none other than Minamo, and promise of their reunion has been fulfilled via serendipity, but that is just the beginning of their story.\n\nThe game comes with lost of bonus unlockable elements, from BGM and CG galleries to animated videos, all accessible via main menu. Character animation is limited to talking only while the rest relies on still drawn in different poses. The game also relies on zooming and scrolling to emphasize certain scenes or when introducing new characters to the scene. Voice-acting in the game is present for everyone but the main character.",

        "description": "WipEout Fusion is a futuristic racing game with action elements. Players compete in the F9000 Anti-Gravity Race League, driving hovercrafts and sometimes using weapons against opponents to achieve victory.\n\nLike WipEout 3, the game contains single-race and league modes, as well as two-player split screen gameplay. The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed.\n\nNew weapons include the proton cannon, flamethrower, gravity bomb, super missiles, seismic field, nitro rocket, and others. A total of eight vehicles and teams are available: Xios (Finland), Feisar (European Consortium), Van Uber (Germany), Tigron (Russia), EG-R (China), G-tech (Japan), Auricom (North America), and Piranha (Brazil). Once a team has completed a sufficient amount of challenges in the Challenge mode, it acquires a license for a unique super weapon.\n\nAnother new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.",

        "description": "What was once a peaceful kingdom of Duhan has been radically changed due to a flash that tore through the night. Thousands were killed and the kingdom is ruined, and only a handful remain after this flash devastated the land. The main city in a state of perpetual cold, separated from the outside world. The Queen of Duhan has disappeared into the depths of a giant labyrinth beneath the castle. It is up to the game's protagonist and his chosen companions to explore the Duhan labyrinth and find the answers and the means to revert this unfortunate state.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins, Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land is very similar to early Wizardry games. The game's environments consist of the town, where the player can recruit characters into the party, rest and buy supplies, and the vast maze-like 3D dungeon. The bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring said dungeon, trying to find the right way through the maze, collecting treasure, triggering scenes, and fighting enemies in turn-based combat.\n\nThere are eight character classes in the game: Warrior, Priest, Thief, Sorcerer, Bishop, Samurai, Knight, and Ninja. A party is formed by selecting characters belonging to these classes, some of which have their own background stories. Some of the classes will only join a character who has had a certain amount of experience exploring the dungeon.\n\nThieves can unlock chests and disarm traps, which is done by participating in a mini-game that involves repeating a pattern of buttons within a time limit. Magic requires memorizing a fixed amount of spell units per level. By collecting components and taking them to the shop the player can craft a stone used to upgrade spells.",

First, playing as Woody, the player must rescue the kids from this weird park. After that, these characters are unlocked and can be controlled to continue the game story.\n\nThe game is an action platformer in which the protagonists traverse cartoon-like 3D levels composed out of passages, platforms, and bridges. Extra lives are scattered through the stages, and can also be won by playing slot machines. The stages contain many hazards and traps with light puzzle-solving elements. Woody's trademark beak can be used to fend off enemies, climb wooden boxes, open doors, and trigger switches.",

Up to four players can compete in each of the multiplayer modes.\n\nVarious power-ups can be picked up on the arenas.

        "description": "World of Outlaws: Sprint Car Racing 2002 is a game that focuses on the niche motorsport of sprint car racing. The game is for the most part a simulation of real-life racing, with a career mode and a number of customization options.\n\nThe game has a number of different modes to choose from. The most basic of these are the time trial and single race options, both of which are self-explanatory. There is also an arcade championship mode that lets you jump right in and start as part of a professional racing team, complete with your own vehicle and free maintenance. The career mode is the most in-depth of all the options, as it puts you in the shoes of an aspiring sprint car driver. You'll start off with just enough cash to buy a basic car and enter a local event. The goal is to win the event, or at least place high enough in it to begin building your reputation as a racer. One of the keys to success is impressing sponsors, who will offer you contracts if you do well enough. At first, because you're low on funds, you'll have to wait for events to come to your local track. As your wealth and reputation grow, you'll be able to travel to larger events with larger prizes and more visibility.\n\nEach event consists of a battery of races and a somewhat complicated process of progression and elimination that you'll need to brave on your way to the prize. At the beginning of each championship or career race, you'll have the option of taking a few practice laps to get warmed up. Once you've gotten a feel for the track, you can move on ahead to the qualifying race.\n\nThe qualifying race has you complete three laps around the track. The first is to get you up to speed, while the second and third have you trying to post a good time for each. The times you post in these laps are compared with the times of other qualifying racers, and the starting position of each racer is decided in this way. After you've received your position, you'll move on to one of two heats involving 12 racers each. The heats usually consist of five laps, and the top six cars from each heat move on to the trophy dash, while the bottom six cars from each heat are pushed into the B race. The racers participating in the trophy dash race another five laps or so to vie for a better starting position in the main event. The racers in the B race complete another five laps as well, and the top four cars from this event are brought back into the main event.\n\nAfter this somewhat process of elimination and progression, the top 12 cars will compete for the trophy in the main race, which typically consists of 15 to 20 laps. In single player mode, you have your chance to race against the World Of Outlaw drivers, from Steve Kinser to Stevie Smith.",

The developers took a different approach and dropped everything to try and write new technology for the PS2 version. As the game was late, there was a lot of pressure from publisher SEGA and the shipped PS2 version did not run as well as the Xbox version.\n\nsource: Richard Geldreich on Twitter (27th January 2020)"

However, the game has an improved edit mode, so you can edit the team's name, flag, logo, shirts, and stadium.\n\nYou can use the 'shop' system to unlock hidden features such as classic teams. The game also has a training mode, and a challenge mode, in which you have to dribble around cones as quick as you can. Replays can be fast-forwarded and rewound, and the view can be rotated. The advantage rule is now implemented, so a foul will only stop play if the fouled team suffers from it.",

The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape.\n\nNot all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.",

        "description": "Worms Blast is a puzzle game similar in concept to Puzzle Bobble, with several important distinctions and gameplay features taken from Worms games. Instead of releasing and matching bubbles, the player has to color blocks on a hexagonal grid. Unlike most Bust-A-Move variants, the player character can move right and left, sailing in a boat. Various weapons, such as bazooka, grenades, dynamite, and others, can be used to fire at the blocks, coloring them on impact. Like in the main, artillery-based Worms games, holding down the fire button increases the power of the weapon, affecting the distance it travels.\n\nIf the player hits a block that is either the same color as the missile fired, that block and any other same-colored blocks adjacent to it will be destroyed. Differently-colored blocks will not be affected by shooting at them; however, if they are held solely by a group of blocks of the same color, they will fall into the water when that group disappears. Blocks with rainbows on them can count as any color. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, there are no walls in single-player mode. If the player aims the weapon outside of the screen, a heavy object might fall on the player-controlled boat, damaging it.\n\nThe game's main mode is called \"Puzzle mode\": the player completes various stages, the goal being different in each (e.g. shooting down certain forms of blocks, avoiding hostile blocks that move around the screen, etc.). Beside this mode, the game features a single-player tournament mode with high scores, as well as a variety of multiplayer modes. The action component is particularly noticeable in this mode, since the walls between the areas will periodically open, allowing players to use this opportunity to shoot at each other's boats.",

While the game has full single and multiplayer options, most of the play centers around a detailed career mode where an entire racing season can be experienced.\n\nTo start, the game allows the selection of a professional rally car (from a set of 7) and a driver. Selecting a driver also includes the co-driver/navigator that assists during the actual races. Playing an actual season involves completing 14 events in the game's 80+ tracks. Each track matches its real world counterpart and rendered in accurate terrain and weather detail - asphalt to dirt roads to rocky trails.\n\nIn addition to the normal driving controls and feedback common to most racing games, the game adds a simple car damage system that not only affects the visual appearance (muddied paint, busted lights) of the vehicles but also the gameplay. A particularly brutal race for instance, might leave the car listing and handling poorly towards the end of the event.\n\nTwo players can compete in a time-based competition.",

        "description": "WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain is a follow-up to WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, showcasing more than 55 WWE superstars (including Brock Lesnar, Scott Steiner, Rey Mysterio, Bill Goldberg, and others), as well as adding famous wrestlers of former times (\"WWE Legends\") to the roster.\n\nThe game features real-life attributes of strength, submission, technique, speed and stamina for each wrestler. These new attributes allow players to wear down their opponents and take advantage of each Superstar's unique abilities and extensive move sets, expanding the amount of stances to sixteen (as opposed to four in the previous game). The presentation has been enhanced with new camera angles, superstar voiceovers, additional animations, and new arena and crowd elements.\n\nPlayers can create, play and develop their own superstar through various storylines staged by the WWE. New match types and modes are available as well. Players can track their progress with seasonal stats, earn money to build up superstar abilities, and unlock hidden features.",

        "description": "In the 21st century, a group of scientists discovered a mysterious monolith near the Lake Turkana in Kenya. The substance contained within it, which later received the name Zohar, has quickly become a source of immense power. Humanity was eventually able to reach the stars, founding the Galaxy Federation and colonizing known space.\n\nIn the year 4767 T.C. (Transcend Christ) or 7277 A.D., according to the old year-counting system, humanity has long left the planet Earth, which has been renamed Lost Jerusalem and erased from star maps, the way to it no longer known. The original Zohar substance has been proven to be too dangerous, and was sealed on the planet Old Miltia, most humans resorting to use less powerful device called Zohar emulators instead. However, some organizations still long to re-discover the true Zohar, believing it to be the path to Lost Jerusalem.\n\nMeanwhile, a new race of aliens known as Gnosis has emerged. The Vector Corporation decides to develop an android called KOS-MOS to be the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis. Shion Uzuki is a young engineer leading this project. After having completed KOS-MOS, Shion and her team are attacked by the Gnosis. Through a series of events, Shion becomes the target of the terrorist U-TIC organization and other mysterious figures, whose goal seems to be the secret path to Old Miltia. Other characters become involved in the conflict, and eventually Shion realizes that she is not alone in her struggle, and that the initial Gnosis attack was but a small part of a complex, multi-layered conspiracy.\n\nXenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's boost gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.\n\nEach character has a unique tree of ether spells they can learn by spending ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.",

It should also be pointed out that some of these events are *modified* (like the game) from those listed in the similar Xenogears: Perfect Works guide.\n\nHistory and language\nLike Xenogears, Xenosaga is full of references to the Bible and to Jewish mythology in general. For example, the mysterious energy Zohar means \"glow\" in Hebrew and is one of the central aspects of Jewish mysticism (Kabbala).\nThe sign written on Zohar is Alef, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.\nOne of the game's main characters is called Ziggurat. Ziggurats (also spelled Zikkurat or Ziqqurat) were tower-temples in the ancient Mesopotamia (today's Iraq). The famous Babel Tower was most probably also a ziggurat.\nThe scientist Joachim Mizrahi, one of the game's central figures, has probably Israeli ancestors. \"Mizrahi\" is a popular family name in Israel, and the word itself means \"eastern\" in Hebrew.\nAnother Biblical trivia: the 13 Zohar emulators possessed by Kukai Foundation are named after the 12 pupils of Jesus and Jesus himself (Child of Mary). The Zohars are also numbered - by letters of the Hebrew alphabet, that also serve as numbers (alef = 1, bet = 2, etc).\nDid you notice how Albedo always calls Momo and other Realian girls ma p\u00eache? This is a common affectionate word used in French language, but literally it means my peach. Does it have any other meaning in the context? Yes, it does: momo also means \"peach\", this time in Japanese.\nSpecial edition\n\nGot about $200 to burn? For that cash, you can pick up a Special Edition Box of Xenosaga, which comes with the game on two DVDs (with different artwork on the discs), an artbook, a keychain, a portfolio, and a cold-cast statue of KOS-MOS.\n\nAwards\nGameSpy\n2003 \u2013 PS2 RPG of the Year\n2003 \u2013 #10 PS2 Game of the Year\n\nInformation also contributed by Unicorn Lynx and WildKard\n\n More"

        "description": "XGIII: Extreme G Racing is a futuristic racing game. Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.\n\nUnlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the \"nitro\" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.",

The player controls a futuristic aircraft and tries to reach the end of each stage, where a boss fight waits.\n\nThere are several different types of attacks: a regular shot, which can be upgraded five times by power-ups dropped by enemy ships; a side attack is a risky manoeuvre that involves pushing the control stick quickly left and right to destroy enemies to the left or right of the player's ship. This will also increase the score multiplier. The ship's exhaust can also be put to use by damaging enemies that come up from behind. The final weapon is the barrier, which creates a protective ring around the player, destroying all enemies that touch it.\n\nThe game also features a difficulty setting adjusted dynamically by the score - the higher the player scores, the more difficult the game gets. XII Stag also has checkpoints in each level, which compare the current player's score to the high score at this point in the game.",

        "description": "XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum's book The Bourne Identity, and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. The hero knows almost nothing except that he must be important, since everyone is trying to kill him. Gradually uncovering the mystery, the hero, learns more about his secret agent past and his curious name: XIII.\n\nThe player unravels clues, trying to solve a conspiracy set in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions: for example, head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, the game has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than fifteen weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and plenty of enemies in levels spread all over the world. During the game, the player can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.",

They just had to send pictures - and the other viewers decided, which was the meanest looking villain, you could imagine.\n\nWell, in the end, they didn't choose some mean looking guy - but a very, very mean, in a strange way, looking, young, ultra-nerdish guy. So, if you come across some really questionable villain who looks a bit like Bill Gates, you know why...\n\nReferences\n\nIn the Canyon level, you can find three deserted graves. Unlike the tomb in the garden of the mansion, later on in the game, the names written on them do not refer to in-game characters, but to members of the development team: Olivier Dupin (2D), Marc Chevalier (3D Artists and Special Effects) and Nath Moschetti (Artistic Director).\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe groovy seventies music is composed by artists associated with the San Francisco's Future Primitive Sound art collective. The soundtrack has been made available exclusively in a XIII game bundle that could be ordered from the Ubisoft site.

        "description": "Loosely based on historical events that took place in England in the 15th century, known as the Wars of the Roses (a battle for power between the houses of Lancaster and York), Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses sees the heroes of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga and card game series, Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba, assume the identity of the head of the Lancaster house (Red Rose, later the Tudor dynasty), Henry Tudor, and the leader of the Yorkist faction (White Rose), Christian Rosenkreuz, respectively. The player controls a Rose Duelist, who is initially sent by Henry Tudor (Yugi) and the Lancastrians to Stonehenge, with the mission of disrupting a barrier imposed by the White Rose forces. However, Rosenkreuz (Seto) arrives and offers the hero to side with the Yorkists. From that point on, the player can choose to follow either the Red or the White Rose, in two different scenarios.\n\nLike most other Yu-Gi-Oh! video game adaptations, this is a strategy card game. The duels of the game take place on a 7x7 table; each player commands a \"Deck Leader\", who acts as the representation of the player character's hit point, as well as the central square on the map around which cards can be placed. Monsters can be navigated freely on the board, with the goal of surrounding and defeating the opponent's Deck Leader. Various field bonuses and card fusions are also present.",

        "description": "In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..\n\nZone of the Enders is an action game that primarily focuses on combat between the player-controlled Jehuty and hostile Orbital Frames. Jehuty can use an energy sword, an energy projectile, and various sub-weapons to defeat his foes. As the player progresses, Jehuty's arsenal grows, and he is able to learn new abilities. Jehuty can also hover and fly, grab and throw enemies, and use booster jets to move quickly and dodge enemy attacks. Some objectives require the player to minimize damage to nearby buildings and civilians.",

He discovers that the source of the Metatron is actually an abandoned battle robot, Jehuty (seen in the original Zone of the Enders), and decides to use the machine against BAHRAM.\n\nDingo soon realises that there's more to the story than simply wanting to own a powerful machine, as treachery and evil power comes into play. It's up to you to control the Jehuty and fight BAHRAM .\n\nZone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner is a sequel to Zone of the Enders. Like its predecessor, it is an action game that concentrates on piloting the giant mecha Jehuty (walking or hovering in the air), engaging in battles against other robots, using his energy sword and secondary weapons and techniques. Unlike the first game, there is no \"world map\" to travel on; the player is taken to the next stage automatically. Jehuty can upgrade his abilities by destroying enemies and gathering experience. Sub-weapons are acquired after having successfully eliminated a boss enemy. The game also allows the player to participate in a battle against a friend in a two-player battle mode, or try out the special VR training missions.",
